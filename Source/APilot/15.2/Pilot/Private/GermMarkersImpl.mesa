The procedures provide handles which allow access to sections of the germ code for, e.g., making it readonly and throwing away the non-resident portion after booting.DIRECTORY  GermMarkers;GermMarkersImpl: PROGRAM  EXPORTS GermMarkers =  BEGIN<< After the germ has executed (in ProcessRequests), it will want to clear out that code which it no longer needs (init and floppy code).  These marker pages delimit that uneeded memory by being packaged to surround it like so: GatesOfHellMarker, Resident, BeforeMarker, Floppy, MiddleMarker, Initialization, AfterMarker.  First init code is flushed, then floppy code is flushed.GatesOfHellMarker marks the beginning of germ-space, used as a delimiter for code pages to be marked readOnly. >>  GatesOfHellMarker: PUBLIC PROCEDURE =    {NULL};  BeforeMarker: PUBLIC PROCEDURE =    {NULL};  MiddleMarker: PUBLIC PROCEDURE =    {NULL};  AfterMarker: PUBLIC PROCEDURE =    {NULL};<< These marker pages delimit alternate sections for common heads, or heads which include two versions of the head, only one of which is used on any given system.  An example is the DLight head, with HSIO and SCSI alternates.  At runtime PilotDiskFace(Extra).WhoToSwapOut tells which can be cleared out.  The procedure returned by WhoToSwapOut needs to be in the pack intended to be swapped. >>  HeadFirstSwapMarker: PUBLIC PROCEDURE =    {NULL};  HeadSecondSwapMarker: PUBLIC PROCEDURE =    {NULL};  END.LOG 6-Mar-85 13:52:52	CAJ 	Created file.15-Jan-88 12:36:11	CAJ 	Added HeadFirstSwapMarker, HeadSecondSwapMarker.
