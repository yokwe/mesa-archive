All rights reserved.---- Purpose: This files contains the documentation for OfflineDiagnosticsDove.boot--1.0  Introduction       The OfflineDiagnosticsDove.boot is a OfflineDiagKernel client. It is a      collection of offline diagnostics suitable for ether-booting or disk-booting.          This boot file contains the following:          	1. Ethernet Tests  	2. Floppy Disk Tests  	3. Floppy Disk Utility 	4. Formatter, Scavenger and Bad Page Utility  	5. Rigid Disk Tests 	6. Keyboard/Display/Mouse/Beeper Tests  	7. System Configuration Utility     Other diagnostics can and probably will be added. This document, however,     will be updated from release to release to reflect the boot file contents     for that release.          The user interface is a menu-driven interface, so most screen are self-     explanatory. Also the program is very tolerant and forgiving when it comes     to user inputs. Erroneous inputs will result in a prompt giving the proper     input range to the user. Online help is also available by entering a      lone question mark or a menu item followed by a question mark; the lone     question mark gives a global help text that applies to the entire menu,     the latter gives help to that specific menu item.2.0  First screen: Login Screen     Diagnostic users are divided into 5 classes as follows:	 Normal Users - No login needed. Selecting 1 will advance to next menu.         System Administrators - Password is "rgmsn"	 Field Service  - Password is "rexifsn"	 Manufacturing - Password is "fle"	 Programmers/Engineers - Password is "do8"	      The tests each class of users can run may be different depending on the     riskiness of the tests. Generally, the test runnable by the Normal Users are     harmless, so no login is required. All the other classes of users must enter     a valid password. The passwords entered determine the contents of the menus     that will be generated and presented to the users for selection. The     specification of who can run each test is done by the diagnostic programmer.     Also, the presentation order of the menu items can be different for      different classes of users.          The passwords are meant to create a sense of caution, not to exclude access;     they are therefore given above.2.1  Screen Lay-Out  +===========================================================================+  I   ID   Xerox (C) Xerox Corporation 1985, 1986.

This     screen's help text is as follows:     Log In Help        Normal users can only run harmless tests that give qualitative	indications. No login is needed        Other users can run tests that may damage the system. They must login with        a valid password.          "1" identifies the user as a normal user. All menu generated will only     contain items selectable by this class of users. This selection exits the      Login Screen and presents the Subsystem Selection Screen to the user.     "2" identifies the user as a System Administrator. The user will be prompted     to enter a password. If the password entered is incorrect, the user must     reselect a menu item and start over.     "3" identifies the user as a Technical Representative, from Manufacturing or     a programmer. The user will be prompted to enter a password. The password     entered will identify the user's organization. Again, if the password entered     is incorrect, the user must reselect a menu item and start over.     STOP has no effect here except clearing the screen and re-presenting the     Login screen.3.0  Second Screen: Subsystem Selection Screen     This screen is displayed after a user has successfully logged in. This screen     presents to the user the diagnostic packages bound into this boot file.3.1  Screen Lay-Out  +===========================================================================+  I   ID   Xerox (C) Xerox Corporation 1985, 1986.

The     menu item numbers select the indicated diagnostic package. the STOP key      returns to the Login Screen where a user can re-login. "?" displays the     following help text:  Useful information    The blinking cursor points to the applicable prompt. Do as prompted    SPACE and CR are input terminators. BACKSPACE erases the last input character    A question mark alone (?) gives help to the entire menu    <n> followed by ? gives help to the item identified by n    UNDO inverts the screen    STOP aborts the current test, if allowed; or exits the current menu    The current selection is displayed at the top of the screen     Once a diagnostic package has been selected, the normal menus associated      with that package for the loggged in user class will be displayed. For the     details, refer to the documentation for that particular package.                    LOGCreated on  22-Jan-86  by KL
