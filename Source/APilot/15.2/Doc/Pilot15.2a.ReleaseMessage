Smashes of disk data may occur otherwise, making the disk unusable unless an erase is done.  These Installer and BWS bootfiles will be announced at a later time.No changes to Viewboard hardware is needed to run Pilot 15.2.Installing the Unix portion of XGV-PC (Bounty) workstations under Unix using the "Xerox Basic Software for SCO Unix" diskettes is described in:	[Snert:OSBU North:Xerox]<APilot>15.1.2>Doc>		Bounty Unix InstallationIf "Xerox Basic Software for SCO Unix" has already been installed it should be removed (using custom) and then reinstalled.BWS installation then proceeds as usual with the bootfile which will be released later.Installing the OS/2 portion of XGV-PC workstations under OS/2 is accomplished as follows:    First time installation      - Run Install from the basic software diskette and go through installation procedure       - Run Configurator from the XGV group desktop, selecting VGA adapter and resolution          - Perform an Update and Exit in the Configurator          - Power cycle at the end of installation    Reinstallation or upgrade to the new VGA executable which allows use of display adapters and monitors      - Run Install from the appropriate diskette          - answer no to resize hard disk (unless you really want to reinstall XGV-PC            on a different sized disk)          - answer yes to reload executables      - Run Configurator from the XGV group desktop, selecting VGA adapter and resolution          - Perform an Update and Exit in the Configurator          - Reboot as instructedBWS installation then proceeds as usual with the bootfile which will be released later.PROBLEMS AND ARS Please submit all problem reports via the System Software:OSBU North Adobe (AR) System, specifying the version as 15.2.
