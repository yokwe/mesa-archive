Set the frame counts below to allocate more than enough frames.-- 2. Run the germ through all of its paces: etherboot, inload,--   outload, and teledebug. If you want to skip etherbooting,--   just install a copilot /5, interrupt and teledebug it, then proceed.-- 3. Use LocalFrameTool in "local germ" mode to see how many--   frames of the various sizes have been completely unused.-- 4. Set the final frame weights as follows: Eliminate most--   of the unused intermediate sized frames (say, sizes 2..6).--   Leave some excess small frames [0..1] because they are popular--   and cheap, and some excess large ones for emergencies,--   hoping that frame promotion will save you in a jam.--   Leaving one "excess" frame in several intermediate sizes--   will allow the LocalFrameTool to be able to show if forced--   promotion has passed through that frame size. This can be done--   on a germ with a lot of exercise on it to verify the weights.FRAMEPAGES: 0;  -- otherwise MakeBoot uses a default of 3(?)FRAMEWEIGHT:  0, 12, INDIRECT[1];FRAMEWEIGHT:  1,  5, INDIRECT[2];FRAMEWEIGHT:  2,  3, INDIRECT[3];FRAMEWEIGHT:  3,  3, INDIRECT[4];FRAMEWEIGHT:  4,  2, INDIRECT[5];FRAMEWEIGHT:  5,  2, INDIRECT[6];FRAMEWEIGHT:  6,  4, INDIRECT[7];FRAMEWEIGHT:  7,  1, INDIRECT[8];FRAMEWEIGHT:  8,  2, INDIRECT[9];FRAMEWEIGHT:  9,  1, INDIRECT[10];FRAMEWEIGHT: 10,  1, INDIRECT[11];FRAMEWEIGHT: 11,  1, INDIRECT[12];FRAMEWEIGHT: 12,  0, INDIRECT[13];FRAMEWEIGHT: 13,  0, INDIRECT[14];FRAMEWEIGHT: 14,  0, INDIRECT[15];FRAMEWEIGHT: 15,  0, INDIRECT[16];FRAMEWEIGHT: 16,  0, INDIRECT[17];FRAMEWEIGHT: 17,  0, INDIRECT[18];FRAMEWEIGHT: 18,  0, INDIRECT[19];FRAMEWEIGHT: 19,  0, INDIRECT[20];FRAMEWEIGHT: 20,  0, INDIRECT[21];FRAMEWEIGHT: 21,  0, INDIRECT[22];FRAMEWEIGHT: 22,  0, INDIRECT[23];FRAMEWEIGHT: 23,  0, INDIRECT[24];FRAMEWEIGHT: 24,  0, INDIRECT[25];FRAMEWEIGHT: 25,  0, INDIRECT[26];FRAMEWEIGHT: 26,  0, INDIRECT[27];FRAMEWEIGHT: 27,  0, INDIRECT[28];FRAMEWEIGHT: 28,  0, INDIRECT[29];FRAMEWEIGHT: 29,  0, INDIRECT[30];FRAMEWEIGHT: 30,  0, END;  -- "30" = PrincOps.LastAVSlot.MDSBASE: 0;  -- per PrincOps.GFTBASE: 1000B;  -- Per PrincOpsExtras2.mesaCODEBASE: 1;  -- (MakeBoot will put the code after the global and local frames)-- LOG-- Feb 5, 81 11:17 AM   WDK       Deleted obsolete PDAPAGES.-- 28-Oct-81 11:35:58   WDK       Moved to mds 0.
