--Pilot15.3c.ReleaseMessageSubject: Pilot 15.3c availableFrom: Pilot ImplementorsTo: MesaUsers:All Areas, PilotImplementors:All Areas, GuamImplementorscc: Guam Platform TeamReply-to: Guam Platform TeamPilot 15.3 supports Xerox XGV-PC (Bounty) and 6085-2 (Duke) and GVWin (Guam).PILOT 15.3c CONTENT section below identifies functionality included in this update.  WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE and WHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATION identify the locations of the software and documentation, respectively, for this release.  INSTALLING PILOT 15.3 describes how to install Pilot 15.3.  PROBLEMS AND ARS describes how to submit trouble reports against the 15.3 software and documentation.  ** PILOT 15.3c CONTENTPilot 15.3c contains a complete list of DF's and is based on 15.2.2 (thus it includes all 15.2, 15.2.1 content, and 15.2.2 content).  It is built in such a way to support all Pilot 15.x workstation platforms.Pilot 15.3c includes the following new content:  1. New CoProcessorStreamImpl to fix a virtual memory leak.    2. Changed UserTerminalHeadGuam to handle 16-color mode color blends.    Pilot 15.3c also includes the following content that was previously released in 15.3b:   1. Initial support for GVWin Platform (Guam).      2. New TrapezoidBltImpl.  Proposed bug fix for several problems exhibited by Illustrator.  Changed to reflect the ColorBlt semantics changes (i.e. a source pattern address must point to the word to be used first, not necessarily to the beginning of the pattern block).      3. New TextBltImpl to truncate negative numbers towards negative infinity instead of 0. GV Win AR 244.      4. Previous 15.x version of SetGMTUsingEthernet is now called SetGMTUsingEthernetDuke.  14.0 version of SetGMTUsingEthernet has been moved into this release (and is still called SetGMTUsingEthernet).  BasicHeadsBounty and BasicHeadsGuam use SetGMTUsingEthernet.  BasicHeadsDuke uses SetGMTUsingEthernetDuke.      5. New TTYPortChannel to prevent the input buffer from overflowing.      6. Rebuilt diagnostics for XGV-PC (Bounty) and 6085-2 (Duke).      7. Initial support for GVWin Online Diagnostics.      CHANGED DFs for Pilot 15.3c:	CHStub.df  --  nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	ComSoft.df -- new TTYPortChannel	CoProcessorStream.df  --  Guam support 	Courier.df  --  nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	DiagDiskUtilDuke15.df -- rebuilt due to BasicHeadsDuke rebuild	DiagEtherDuke15.df  -- included DF only	DiagFloppyDiskUtilDove14.df  -- included DF only	DiagRDDuke15.df  -- included DF only	FacesBounty.df -- pick up SetGMTUsingEthernet from 15.3, not 14.0	FacesCommon.df  -- Guam support...new ColorDisplayFace, recompiled CoProcessorFace, moved in 14.0 version of SetGMTUsingEthernet, renamed 15.3 SetGMTUsingEthernet to SetGMTUsingEthernetDuke, changes to TextBltImpl.	FacesGuam.df  -- new Guam DF (new BasicHeadsGuam, OptionalHeadsGuam, and WSOnlyHeadsGuam, UserTerminalHeadGuam)	FacesPrivateDuke.df -- for rename of SetGMTUsingEthernetDuke	FacesPublicDerivedDuke.df -- for rename of SetGMTUsingEthernetDuke	GermBounty.df  -- rebuilt Bounty.germ for new TeledebugImpl	GermDuke.df  -- rebuilt Duke.germ for new TeledebugImpl	GermGuam.df  -- new Guam DF for Guam.germ	ImageProcessing.df  -- recompiled TrapezoidBlt.bcd, new TrapezoidBltImpl.mesa	MesaPublic.df  -- rebuilt ColorBlt	NSDerived.df  -- nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	NSFriends.df  -- nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	NSPrivate.df  -- nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	OFLFloppyExecDuke15.df  -- rebuilt on latest pieces	OfflineCartridgeTapeDiagDuke.df  -- rebuilt due to BasicHeadsDuke rebuild	OfflineDiagKernelDuke15.df  -- rebuilt due to BasicHeadsDuke rebuild	OfflineFloppyDiagsDove14.df  -- included DF only	OfflineScannerDiagDuke.df  -- rebuilt due to BasicHeadsDuke rebuild	OnlineDiagnosticsGuam.df  -- new Guam DF for Online Diagnostics	Phonenet.df  -- nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	PilotPublic.df  -- nothing really changed.....shouldn't really be here	RS232CGuam.df  -- new Guam DF for RS232C support	ServicesStubs.df  -- recompiled ServicesStubs on latest pieces	SysConfigurationUtility15.df  -- included DF only** WHERE TO GET SOFTWAREThe archive directory includes only changed components.  It has a structure which is convenient for the Pilot implementors.         [Snert:OSBU North]<APilot>15.3>	                          15.3>DF>				  15.3c>DF>				   The <15.3>DF> and <15.3c>DF> directories contain a complete list of dfs.** WHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATIONDocumentation for this release may be found on.  It is incomplete at this time, since GVWin has not been released yet.	[Snert:OSBU North:Xerox]<APilot>15.3>Doc>.** INSTALLING PILOT 15.3Installation steps for 15.3 on GVWin (Guam):NOTE: Installation of GVWin is not complete at this time.Installation steps for 15.3 on 6085-2 (Duke) and XGV-PC (Bounty):Important:  You must always use an Installer bootfile based upon Pilot 15.2 [or 15.3] when dealing with large logical volumes (approximately 300MB).  Smashes of disk data may occur otherwise, making the disk unusable unless an erase is done.  These Installer and BWS bootfiles will be announced at a later time.No changes to Viewboard hardware is needed to run Pilot 15.3.Installing the Unix portion of XGV-PC (Bounty) workstations under Unix using the "Xerox Basic Software for SCO Unix" diskettes is described in:	[Snert:OSBU North:Xerox]<APilot>15.2>Doc>		Bounty Unix InstallationIf "Xerox Basic Software for SCO Unix" has already been installed it should be removed (using custom) and then reinstalled.BWS installation then proceeds as usual with the bootfile which will be released later.Installing the OS/2 portion of XGV-PC workstations under OS/2 is accomplished as follows:    First time installation      - Run Install from the basic software diskette and go through installation procedure       - Run Configurator from the XGV group desktop, selecting VGA adapter and resolution          - Perform an Update and Exit in the Configurator          - Power cycle at the end of installation    Reinstallation or upgrade to the new VGA executable which allows use of display adapters and monitors      - Run Install from the appropriate diskette          - answer no to resize hard disk (unless you really want to reinstall XGV-PC            on a different sized disk)          - answer yes to reload executables      - Run Configurator from the XGV group desktop, selecting VGA adapter and resolution          - Perform an Update and Exit in the Configurator          - Reboot as instructedBWS installation then proceeds as usual with the bootfile which will be released later.** PROBLEMS AND ARS Please submit all problem reports via the "GV Win:OSBU North" Adobe (AR) System, specifying the version as 15.3.  It helps speed attention to the problem if the subject line begins with the name of the subsystem involved in the problem reported.The Pilot Implementors
