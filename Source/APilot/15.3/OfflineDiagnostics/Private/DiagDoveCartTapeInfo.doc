The original diagnostic   implementation and functionality remain untouched for the most parts.  Most   of the changes lie in the user interface portion of the diagnostic.   Known differences between the 8090 and 6085 Offline cartridge tape diagnostics asseen by the 6085 diagnostics:1) The 6085 offline diagnostic cannot detect if a tape has been inserted or removed.   This a 6085 hardware limitation.      Workaround: Run ReadSector with a re-try count of 1.  It returns with a notReady   if a tape is not inside the drive.  That's about all it can do.   2) The ReadID command is on a 6085 is limited--only the first one works, subsequent   ones fail because the it gets lost.  This a floppy controller limitation.      Workaround: Preceed each ReadID command with a ReadSector.  This forces the read head   to move to the proper location before actually reading the track ID.   3) Maximum number of tracks that the diagnostic can format is 245.  Another controller   limitation.  The 8090 can format the entire tape with one format command.      Workaround: Format the tape 12 times, each format operating up to the maximum 245 track   limit.  This equivalent to 12 stream formats.      4) WriteDelSector is not implemented in the 6085 cartridge tape system.  This command   command will always fail on the 6085 offline diagnostic.      Workaround: NONE    5) Like the floppy disk system, the cartridge tape system competes with the ethernet for bus   accesses.  And like the floppy disk system, the cartridge tape system has lower priority.   But unlike the floppy disk, the cartridge tape cannot perform a retry as easily as the   floppy disk.  The cartridge tape streams continuously, and backing-up and retrying an operation   is a big problem (performance?).  The result of the enet/floppy conflict makes the cartridge   tape diagnostic ineffective causing bogus errors.      Workaround: Turn off the ethernet while running the cartridge tape diagnostic.   See more detailed notes in the module OfflineCartridgeTapeDiagDove.mesa         Supported boot switches:'T or 't - activates the trace mode of the diagnostics.  It outputs to the display which procedure the diagnostics is in.  This is for debug of the user interface portion. 'S or 's - along with a "Technical Support" login, this switch activates several debug and developement aides for the programmer.  It uses the same switches as the original 8090 cartridge tape diagnostics.  They are as follows: WARNING: These have not been tested extensively!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DiagFlTapeCmdDriveImpl:Switch: 71= Display the Command file before executionDiagFlTapeLogImplSwitch: 71= displays the command file array before executionSwitch: 81= do not clear the error log stuff when in subtest optionsSwitch: 91= Display the contents of the IOCBSwitch: 101= Display the time in seconds required to run 1 passSwitch: 110= bypass this subtestOther Documentations:  6085 Cartridge Tape Diagnostic Users Manual
