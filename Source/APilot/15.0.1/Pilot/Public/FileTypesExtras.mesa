In this module are defined the types peculiar to Pilot's own  files as well as the ranges of the types defined by all clients, applications,  and supporting software.  Each such client, application, and supporting software  project should maintain its own file of File Types for its own subrange.  Style Note: The subranges for the different applications, etc., are declared as  subrange types of CARDINAL.  The constants are declared to be values of the type  File.Type (the correct type to be passed to thee File.Create operation of Pilot).  The value of each constant is constructed from the appropriate subrange type in  order that range checking can be applied by the compiler.  This style is recommended  for client maintained files of subranges of File Types.    NOTE: this file is an extension to the FileTypes interface.  It's contents  will be merged back into that interface at some point in the future.    >>  FileType: TYPE = File.Type;  -- Allocation of subranges of File Types  InterlispFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [10048..10078);  END.--LOG16-Jan-85 13:53:14	AWL         Created file.
