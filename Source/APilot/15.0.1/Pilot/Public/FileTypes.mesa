In this module are defined the types peculiar to Pilot's own  -- files as well as the ranges of the types defined by all clients, applications,  -- and supporting software.  Each such client, application, and supporting software  -- project should maintain its own file of File Types for its own subrange.  -- Style Note: The subranges for the different applications, etc., are declared as  -- subrange types of CARDINAL.  The constants are declared to be values of the type  -- File.Type (the correct type to be passed to thee File.Create operation of Pilot).  -- The value of each constant is constructed from the appropriate subrange type in  -- order that range checking can be applied by the compiler.  This style is recommended  -- for client maintained files of subranges of File Types.  FileType: TYPE = File.Type;  -- These are copied from PilotFileTypes.mesa; nobody should be using them  PilotFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [0..256);  tUnassigned: File.Type = [PilotFileType[0]];  -- Allocation of subranges of File Types  MesaFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [256..512);  DCSFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [512..768);  TestFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [768..896);  SBSOFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [896..960);  -- OPD Small Business Systems Operation in Sunnyvale  -- OldStarFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL[1024..2048);  ++ This first range of StarFileType is now unused, but should not be re-assigned until as late a date as possible  CommonSoftwareFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [2048..3072);  DocProcFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [3072..4096);  FileServiceFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [4096..9216);  ServicesFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9216..9280);  MesaDEFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9280..9344); -- Mesa development environment files.  PerformanceToolFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9344..9408); -- "Raw" files from performance tools.  DiagnosticsFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9408..9472); -- Files used by Diagnostics programs.  CADFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9472..9728); -- Files used by the ED CAD programs.  CedarFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9728..9984);  VersatecFileType: TYPE = CARDINAL [9984..10048);  -- The following is the type to use in the absence of any other file type.
