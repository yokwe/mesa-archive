These-- procedures, and all procedures which execute inside any MONITOR-- which they require are not allowed to allocate frames-- from the frame heap - there might not be any!-- If this rule were not followed, we could get a frame fault-- when we held the monitor lock, thus making the required-- procedures inaccessible to the frame fault handler.-- Here are some of the consequences of the above rule:----	~~~ DO ~~~			~~~ DON'T ~~~-- Do RuntimeInternal.WorryCallDebugger	Don't Runtime.CallDebugger-- Do RuntimeInternal.Bug		Don't ERROR or SIGNAL-- Do call coroutines and INLINES	Don't call PROCEDURES-- Do have small arg/result records	Don't have large arg/result records (>14 words)-- To determine if there are any large arg/result records in such code,-- make a code listing and look for occurrences of the "AF" instruction.-- There is also a hack to look for Allocs.ResMemMgr: CONFIGURATION  IMPORTS    DebuggerSwap, KeyboardFace, Pinning, Process, ProcessorFace,    RealMemory, RealMemoryExtras, ResidentHeap, Runtime, RuntimeInternal,    Space, System, StoragePrograms  EXPORTS    DebuggerSwap, DeviceCleanup, MStore, MStoreExtras--**--, ResMemPerf, Runtime,    RuntimeInternal, SpecialRuntime, SpecialSpace, StoragePrograms,     TrackBufferMemory, ResidentHeap, VM, VMData, VMExtraExtras,     VMExtras2--**--,  Zone, ZoneInternal =  BEGIN    FrameImpl;   EarlyVMAllocImpl;    MStoreImpl;    PilotNub;  TrackBufferMemoryImpl;  ResidentHeapImpl;    ResidentMemoryImpl;    VMDataImpl;  VMDataMapImpl;    VMDataUtilities;    ZoneImpl;    END.LOG24-Aug-82 18:17:36   WDK    	Created file from parts of Swapper and Misc configs.28-Oct-82 11:14:31   WDK     	Export ResMemPerf.23-Dec-82 18:41:48   AWL      	NewSpace => Space.
