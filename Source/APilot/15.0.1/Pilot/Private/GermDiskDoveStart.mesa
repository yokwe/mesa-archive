It must list every module packed into GermDiskDove (see the module list in UnpackedGermDiskDove.config) EXCEPT for GermOpsImpl and those modules started by GermOpsImpl (see next paragraph).   Modules not needing starting (this is the same for all germs) are:  GermOpsImpl, ProcessorFace, *HeadDove, GermMarkersImpl.   This code exixts because there is a need to assure that all of this germ's modules are started before GermOpsImpl.ProcessRequests "deallocates" everyone's initialization code.  It would be nicer to have multiple control modules implemented by the former GermOpsImpl.CodeTrap (analogous to Traps.Start) but that code is far too space-consuming to include in the miserly germ.  So instead we have GermDiskDoveStart going through GermOps.Start.  Pish.   This code is bound into this germ via the HeadStartChain. >>DIRECTORY  BootChannelDisk,  BootChannelFloppy,  GermOps USING [Start],  GermOpsImplDove,  GermOpsLinkageImpl,  HeadStartChain USING [Start],  HeadStartChainPlug;GermDiskDoveStart: PROGRAM  IMPORTS BootChannelDisk, BootChannelFloppy, GermOps, GermOpsImplDove,  GermOpsLinkageImpl, HeadStartChainPlug, RemainingHeads: HeadStartChain  EXPORTS HeadStartChain =  BEGIN    -- exported to HeadStartChain  Start: PUBLIC PROC = {RemainingHeads.Start[]};  GermOps.Start[LOOPHOLE[BootChannelDisk, PROGRAM]];  GermOps.Start[LOOPHOLE[BootChannelFloppy, PROGRAM]];  GermOps.Start[LOOPHOLE[GermOpsImplDove, PROGRAM]];  GermOps.Start[LOOPHOLE[GermOpsLinkageImpl, PROGRAM]];  GermOps.Start[LOOPHOLE[HeadStartChainPlug, PROGRAM]];    END.  -- LOG11-Apr-85 17:43:53  CAJ       created file.
