Eleiminated dependencies upon File as those fields are uninterpreted by the clients of this interface. 5-Oct-82 15:15:27		AWL         Modified so that PilotDiskFace is the truth for Label's and all operations on labels20-Oct-82  9:28:07		AWL         Redid nullAddress in terms of LAST[LONG CARDINAL].11-Nov-82 14:22:45              LXD         Redid Addesss in terms of PilotDiskFace.DiskAddress.22-Nov-82 17:28:00              LXD         Renamed field of FileID:  "id" ¬ "name" 2-Jul-86 14:11:19              CAJ         Delete Label, nullBootChainLink, labelOffset, fileIDSizeCheck, GetLabelFilePage, SetLabelFilePage, MatchLabels, NextLabel, FixUpLabel, LabelCheckSum, PilotLabel, and FaceLabel.  Removed boot chain references on Disk address defs.
