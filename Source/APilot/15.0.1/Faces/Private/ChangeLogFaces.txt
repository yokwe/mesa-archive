Unfortunately tape support grew the floppy head so much that it would not pass through the compiler.  In order to keep from splitting the floppy head into 2 modules, I commented out support for the diagnostic face.  I've checked with Howie and Tom and there is currently no problem with this.  However, if public sentiment is for supporting the diagnostic face, I'll split the head for the next release.  (I've found at least one problem with that support so I'm not sure how much its been tested). How about it guys?  --Julie--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: WFaces ¬ FacesCommon.df : Message 005To: SDD-IOArch:OSBU North, DoveSoft:OSBU North, DLionKikuImpl:OSBU North Reply-To: Polen			 3-Jun-87 14:45:09DF files:	FacesCommon.dfChanges:Import Heap for MDS-relief.Edit (from Karey) to BandBLTImpl.mesa for MDS-relief => new BandBLTImpl.bcdMoved GMTUsingIntervalTimer.bcd and SetGMTUsingEthernet.bcd from here into FacesCommon13/14.df, since they use PilotMP, a forked file.

That caused some of the ethernet modules in FacesCommon and EthernnetDove to be edited and recompiled.  The BiparallelPort stuff was changed on IPilotMDS for consistency and verifyability. FacesPrivateDove.df FacesPrivateDlion.df FacesPublicDerivedDove.df FacesPublicDerivedDlion.df were rebound etc. to verify.   An import of ChangeLogFaces.df was added to FacesPublicDerivedDove.df, FacesCommon.df, FacesCommon13.df, FacesCommon14.df,and BiParallelPortDove.df.  Whenever you SModel these DFs you should SModel ChangeLogFaces.df to maintain a record of what has been done to the Faces.  This is more important now because of the forked development and the danger of getting things in one release that might be problems in the other.	Files changed:	BiParallelPortDove.df BiParallelPortHeadDove.df	EthernetDove.df FacesFriendsDove.df FacesPrivateDove.df FacesPublicDerivedDove.df FacesPrivateDLion.df FacesCommon.df FacesCommon13.df FacesCommon14.df EthernetHardFaceDove.bcd EthernetIOFaceDove.bcd EthernetSpecialFaceDove.bcd EthernetHardFaceDove.mesa EthernetHeadDove.bcd EthernetHeadDove.mesa BiParallelPortDove.bcd BiParallelPortDove.symbols BiParallelPortHeadDove.bcd BiParallelPortHeadDove.mesa FacesCommon.cm GMTUsingIntervalTimer.bcd SetGMTUsingEthernet.bcd FacesFriendsDove.cm UnpackedBasicHeadsDove.bcd FacesPrivateDove.cm ProcessorHeadDove.bcd FacesDove.stats BasicHeadsDove.symbols BuildBiParallelPortDove.cm EthernetDove.cm BasicHeadsDove.signals FacesDove.includes FacesDove.includedBy BasicHeadsDove.map UnpackedBasicHeadsDLion.bcd UnpackedBasicHeadsTriDLion.bcd FacesDLion.stats BasicHeadsDLion.symbols BasicHeadsTriDLion.symbols BasicHeadsDLion.bcd BasicHeadsDLion.signals BasicHeadsTriDLion.bcd BasicHeadsTriDLion.signals BasicHeadsDLion.map BasicHeadsTriDLion.mapFacesDLion.includedBy FacesDLion.includes         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: WFaces ¬ Faces*DLion*.df and Faces*DLight.df : Message 001To: SDD-IOArch:OSBU North, HTeam Reply-To: Krauter			15-Jun-87 16:26:56DF files:	FacesPrivateDLion.df	FacesFriendsDLion.df	FacesPublicDerivedDLion.df	FacesPrivateDLion13.df	FacesFriendsDLion13.df	FacesPublicDerivedDLion13.df	FacesPrivateDLion14.df	FacesFriendsDLion14.df	FacesPublicDerivedDLion14.df	FacesPrivateDLight.df	FacesFriendsDLight.df	FacesPublicDerivedDLight.dfChanges:	forkedness and consistency. Files changed:	        Faces*DLion.df have had all files removed from them that differ between 13.0 and 14.0.	Faces*DLion13.df have been created to hold all Faces*DLion.df files that differ between 13.0 and 14.0.	Faces*DLion14.df ditto (this just followed the example of FacesCommon{13,14}.df).	Faces*.df have had their imports stmts use the new 13/14 stuff.	Faces*DLion.cm had building of 13/14 dependent files removed.	Faces*DLion13.cm were created to do what was removed above.	the following files are new on <WFaces>DLion>13> and <WFaces>DLion>14>:		SA4000HeadDLion.*		TridentHeadDLion.*		RealMemoryImplDLion.bcd		UnpackedBasicHeadsDLion.*		UnpackedBasicHeadsTriDLion.*		FacesDLion.stats/include*		BasicHeadsDLion.*		BasicHeadsTriDLion.*		DDC.*		DLionInputOutputExtraExtras.*		SpecialTridentDiskFace.*		TDC.*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
