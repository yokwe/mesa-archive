One is for Ethernet addresses; these must conform to the size and allocation policy layed down in the Ethernet specification.  Another is to construct universal object identifiers within Pilot-based OIS and other compatible systems.  While many Ethernet stations will not care to generate Pilot-compatible universal ids and not all Pilot-based systems will be Ethernet stations, it is nevertheless convenient to a single implementation of such a "serial number".-- The Ethernet specification divides the space of station addresses into two categories:--   physical addresses, in one-to-one correspondence with actual stations--   multicast addresses, each corresponding to a logical group of stations.-- A processor may use its own physical host number concatenated with a sequence number or timestamp to construct a universal object identifier.-- Programs should not make any assumptions about the structure of host numbers other than the IsProcessorID/IsMulticastID distinction defined below (such as attempting to correlate processor types with groups of host numbers).-- Host numbersHostNumber: TYPE = MACHINE DEPENDENT RECORD [  a, b, c, d, e, f: [0..256)];nullHostNumber: HostNumber = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];  -- Not assigned as either a physical or multicast address.-- Processor identifiers (physical addresses)ProcessorID: TYPE = RECORD [HostNumber];-- A processor identifier p MUST have p.a even:IsProcessorID: PROC [hn: LONG POINTER TO HostNumber] RETURNS[BOOLEAN] =  INLINE {RETURN[hn.a MOD 2=0]};nullProcessorID: ProcessorID = [nullHostNumber];-- Multicast identifiers (multicast group addresses)MulticastID: TYPE = RECORD [HostNumber];  -- A multicast identifier m must have m.a odd:IsMulticastID: PROC [hn: LONG POINTER TO HostNumber] RETURNS[BOOLEAN] =  INLINE {RETURN[hn.a MOD 2~=0]};broadcastHostNumber: HostNumber = [255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255];  -- A special multicast address used for broadcasting messages.  END.December 1, 1980  6:18 PM	PXM       Created file 4-Nov-81  8:33:37	AWL         Formatting changes.Time: 26-Sep-84  2:28:39	By: DXG     	Action: Added copyright notice and rebuild for 11.1 release.
