Calling TurnOn when the device is already on may forget any operations currently in progress.

A (different) control block must be passed in with each call for the private use of the head.  cb should be a pointer to a block of EthernetFace.controlBlockSize words.  It must be allocated within the first 64K and must be quad word aligned.  The buffer must have 11 in the low 2 bits (ie it starts one word before a quad word aligned buffer) and less than 32K words long.  When GetStatus[cb] returns anything other than pending, both the control block and the data buffer are available for reuse.   GetStatus: PROCEDURE [cb: ControlBlock] RETURNS [status: Status];  -- Returns the status of the packet associated with this control block.  See the comments on Status below.  GetRetries: PROCEDURE [cb: ControlBlock] RETURNS [CARDINAL];  -- Returns the number of times the packet was retransmitted because of collisions.  GetPacketLength: PROCEDURE [cb: ControlBlock] RETURNS [CARDINAL];  -- Returns the length in words of a recently arrived packet.  GetPacketsMissed: PROCEDURE [DeviceHandle] RETURNS [CARDINAL];  -- Returns the number of input packets missed because a buffer was not ready.  -- TYPES  DeviceHandle: TYPE [1];  GlobalStatePtr: TYPE = Environment.Base RELATIVE POINTER;  Status: TYPE = {    pending, ok, overrun,  -- Input data arrived when FIFO was full    underrun,  -- Output FIFO went empty before end of packet was set    packetTooLong,  -- Input packet didn't fit into buffer    tooManyCollisions,  -- More than 16 attempts to transmit the same packet    crc, crcAndBadAlignment, badAlignmentButOkCrc, otherError};  -- Note: The error conditions are an open ended set to allow a smart driver to collect statistics.  Thus new error conditions may be added to allow more sophisticated data collection, so a driver should not get upset if it encounters a strange error status that it does not understand.
