Microscope.doc				 1-Oct-84 15:37:44 by KrauterMicroscope is a debugger or a client tool which displays PageMap data.  It is useful in analyzing memory flag problems. It displays information about the current contents of real memory and its access, referenced, and dirty status.Microscope displays one kind of information:	*   virtual <=> real correspondence		=== FORM SUBWINDOW ===The fields in the form subwindow operate as follows:Page =   This numeric field specifies the key of the (first) item to be displayed.  This item may reflect a real page number or a virtual page number, depending on which command you operate on it.Count =   This numeric field specifies the number of items to be displayed.verbose   This boolean field specifies that additional data, typically of low interest, should be included in displayed data.  This is, in fact, the actual bits in the item being displayed.volume: {client, local}   This enumerated item determines whether this is a debugger or a client tool.  If {local} is selected, then all data displayed reflects the current volume in which the tool is being run.  If {client} is selected then all data is as read from the client debuggee volume.Display Real Pages!   This command interprets the Page item as a VM page number, and displays information about it's corresponding Real Page.Display VM Pages!   This command interprets the Page item as a Real page number, and displays information about it's corresponding VM Page.The information displayed for each page is always the same:  vmPage#,  vmPointer#,  realPage#,  pageMapFlags.Next!   This command displays the table item following the most-recently-displayed one.Prev!   This command displays the table item preceeding the most-recently-displayed one.	=== EXCEPTIONS ===	Errors which Microscope handles are:User Abort.   displays "..aborted" and gives you back control.Bad Page.  displays "..confused about vmPage...aborted" and gives you back control.  Possible causes are a nonexistant vm page, sometimes caused if a query was made to an unbooted client volume.Bad Volume.  displays "ERROR: volume seems to not be booted...aborted" and returns control.  This occurs when a VM memSize cannot be determined, especially for the client volume.Zero realPage.  displays "ERROR: can't list vmPages for realPage = 0" and returns control.  It's just too fantastic to consider the consequences of asking to list the VM page associated with real page number 0.  Unmapped vmPages are typically said to have real pages of Zero;  While it could be interesting to list all the unmapped virtual memory pages, this really seemed too much of an excess to permit.Time Drag to Display VM Pages.  So sorry, but in order to find a vmPage mapped to the supplied realPage, Microscope must enumerate all of virtual memory asking each VM page if it points to the supplied realPage.  Conversely, searching for the realPage that matches a supplied vmPage is trivial since there exists a table (the revered PageMap) that records which realPage a vmPage is being mapped to at the time of mapping./karey
