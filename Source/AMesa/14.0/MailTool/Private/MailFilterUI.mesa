The application that does the actual filtering calls GetFilters to find out the current set.  When it's done with the filters it calls FreeFilters to release the storage.  (MailFilterUIImpl may choose to give the client a Filter list that points to the same strings that the user is editing, in which case (a) it must ensure that the strings don't change while the client is using them and (b) FreeFilters merely releases the lock so that the strings may once again change.)    END...
