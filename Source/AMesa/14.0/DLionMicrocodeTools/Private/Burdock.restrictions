(Store them into UKSaveDisp by hand if you know what's going on and/or you are desperate.)c2 breaks on write clicks won't write anything.c2 or c3 breaks on read clicks will get trash from _MD when you continue.You can't put breaks on c*, or on instructions without symbols.You can't put breaks on instructions used by more than one task.You can't set a TPC to anything other than an instruction in c1.c2 or c3 breaks in IO tasks may not take when expected since the task has to run one more click to get to the kernel.  (If the current click turns off wakeups so it doesn't get scheduled again....)Breaks after IBDisp won't work.Breaks during bank switching will get confused.Continue after breaking after AltUAddr won't work.You can't write into a task's TC bits.You can't read the 2 (MagTape) input registers that are located in the "output" clump of the function fields.Things will get all confused if you get 2 breaks at the same time.  This can happen if the first break in in c2 or c3 since the EtnerKernel doesn't happen until the next click.
