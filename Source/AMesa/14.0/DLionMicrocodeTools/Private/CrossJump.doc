It's a hack for finding a class of instructions that you might be able to merge together.Remember, it's a hack.  Thus the user interface is a bit crude.  First Boot the CP and Load your microcode.  Then, without changing the selection, poke CrossJump.  Each line of prinout contains a list of addresses.  The instructions at those locations are all identical.The trick is to look at (all) the previous instructions of each canidate to see if any of them can be changed to jump to one of the alternates.  Lots of times you can't do it because of addressing constraints.  If the constraint is loading a link register, you can sometimes move it back an instruction or two.When I scanned the microcode I'm using in the Dicentra, the printout was 2.5 pages long.  I easily found a dozen instructions to merge, and there were another dozen (or so) in parts of the Emulator that I have not changed from the DLion.
