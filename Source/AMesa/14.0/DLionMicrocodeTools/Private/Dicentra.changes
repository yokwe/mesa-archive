// Dicentra.changes, HGM, 13-Jan-83 23:48:28This is a summary of the differences between a Dicentra and a DLion that are interesting to a microcoder.  Gross things like no tasking, and cycle/memory timing differences are not included.Dicentra FY+FZ decodes:  Bank_ is FYNorm = D loads from Ybus, c1 only (like 16K CS DLion)  DebA_ is FYOut = 0 (DLion IOPOdata_) loads from Ybus (not Xbus)  _DebB is FZIn = 8 (DLion _IOPIData) puts info on Xbus  _ExtStat is FZIn = 6 puts external status on Xbus    (Unfortunately, FZIn = 9 (DLion _IOPStatus) Clears high byte.)  ExtCtrl_ is FYOut = 1 (DLion IOPCtl_) loads external control reg from YBus  IO_ is FYNorm = C (the first one) like MAR_  IO_ is FZIn = 7 (the second one) like MAR_  RawRef is FYNorm = E puts all RH bits on Multibus, c1 only  BHEN is FYOut = F reverses normal Multibus BHEN, c1 only, (be sure can also specify ADR0)  ADR0 is FZIn = 0 reverses normal Multibus ADR0, c1 only, (be sure can also specify BHEN)    FYOut = C => IO_ and BHEN  FYOut = E => RawRef and BHEN  Left unused:  FYNorm = 0 and FYNorm = 1 (DLion Enter/Exit kernel) for Kernel simplicity  FYNorm = A and FZNorm = 0 (DLion refresh) for Kernel simplicity  FZNorm 4, 9, A, and B (unused on DLion) for future CUB/DLion compatibility  FYDisp = B (DLion YIODisp) for compatibility with CUB 3 bit map flag dispatch      Weird changes:  Can't do MAP_ and MAR_ in same instruction. (Only used in BandBlt.)  Can't merge low 4 bits of NIA on IBDisp. (Only used by Sunlight.)  MD gets copy of NEW data on writes. (Used by FreeFrame, FreeState, Raven, and ??)  Bank_ works in 2 cycles rather than 3.  _MD timing is fast enough for anything (like ZeroBr after an add).      Fine Print:  Since there are no TC bits to get left in random a state, the first instruction of a task and/or the first instruction of the Trap Handler doesn't need a CANCELBR[xx, 0F].
