The CourierFilter tool will   display the courier information and then pass the buffer to the client by   calling his TriggerProc, just before the display of the packet data.      Client procs typically displays another layer of protocol   header, set <dataPtr> to the beginning of their definition of data, and   return the buffer they recieved.  All buffer output should be done using   SpecialSpy.DisplayProc, which will display in the NSSpyTool fileSW.      If CourierFilter finds itself being deactivated or destroyed, it will destroy   its client, using the window handle passed to it when the trigger was set.  >>  SetCourierTrigger: PUBLIC PROC [    newTrig: SpecialSpy.TriggerProc ¬ NIL, wh: Window.Handle]    RETURNS [oldTrig: SpecialSpy.TriggerProc];  END.
