MAJOR CHANGES=============  Interpret ISO packets  ---------------------    MataHariWindowImpl      added MakeOsiForm,      updated NotifyOsiFilter,      updated BuildSpyArray    MataHariInternal      added OSI to Families, FilterLvl, ConnObject, Params, and SpyProcs    MataHariImpl      added CreateOsiConnObject,      OSI leg in DisplayStateHeader,      OSI leg for displaying level 1 and level 2 headers in DisplayIt,      deletion of OSI addresses in FlushPastState,      OSI leg in DispatcherSpy,      OSI spy, OSI leg for finding/ creating connection in SaveIt    BufferDIsplayImpl01      added OSI leg to Level1Packet    BufferDisplayImpl2      added OSI leg to Level2Packet    BufferDisplayImpl3      wrote new module to actually display the OSI packets        Handle IEEE or Ethernet Decapsulation  -------------------------------------    MataHariImpl      rewrote DispatcherSpy to handle both decapsulations and        to store resultant HighLayer.blockPointer and type in orphan buffers,      used this info in  SaveIt and         in legs for displaying level 1 and level 2 packets in DiplayIt    BufferDisplayImpl01      rewrote BodyAssumingEthernet and Encapsulate to handle both decapsulations,      wrote FindBufferBodyAndType,      used FindBufferBodyAndType in Level1Packet        Add Octet Oriented Display Routines  -----------------------------------    BufferDisplayImpl01      added AppendDecimalBlock, AppendHexBlock, AppendNumberBlock,       AppendHeaderBlock, and PacketDataBlock      called PacketDataBlock when appropriate in Level1Packet and Level2Packet    MataHariImpl      called PacketDataBlock when appropriate in SaveIt,      returned block oriented info from DisplayIt         Fold In Other People's Changes  --------------------------------    gave AOF the compare logsOTHER NOTES===========  1.  I coded this while OSI was still changing.      I used definition files from people's work stations.      Some of these may have changed a lot or no longer exist.      I kept my own copies including:        OSIBuffer.mesa        OSICommonDefs.mesa        OSIHeap.mesa        OSITransportTypes.mesa 	OSITransportTypesExtra.mesa 	OSITypes.mesa         OSITypesExtras.mesa  2.  I changed my copy of EtherMAC to handle IEEE or Ethernet encapsulation.      AOF and BI should use this new copy.        3.  I changed SpecialSpy.TriggerProcs to use dataBlocks, rather than dataPtrs.      I don't know what else this affects.        4.  Level0Packet, Level1Packet, and Level2Packet seem strange to me.       I just updated them to make them do what they already appeared to do.      However, I think that they need real work.      Perhaps successive updaters have accidentally corrupted these routines.
