Every two hours (roughly) it wakes up and polls the time service in order to calculate an accurate time (this operation is hereby called a resync). TimeTracker also does a resync when it is running in CoPilot and CoPilot is reentered.In doing the resync, TimeTracker assumes that a certain percentage of the time servers might have the incorrect time. The larger the percentage assumed incorrect, the less accurate your clock might be. If TimeTracker can determine that the percentage has been set too small, it will log this fact and temporarily assume a higher percentage.TimeTracker registers the command TimeTracker.~ with the executive. This command can be one of the following forms:  TimeTracker.~ start			Start the tracker   TimeTracker.~ stop			Stop the tracker   TimeTracker.~ resync			If tracker started, causes a resync  TimeTracker.~ information		Display the current state of the tracker   TimeTracker.~ log			Display the last thirty events  TimeTracker.~ params pct/P reset/R 	Sets the max percent of faulty servers  					to pct (default 5%, must be in range					[0.. 100]) annd sets the period between					resets to reset minutes (default					approximately 120 minutes).  TimeTracker.~				Display the date and time  The tracker initializes to started with pct = 5 and reset = approximately 120.In addition to the tracker, this program creates a background process which checks for an invalid clock (currently, one which appears to be fast by more than four hours of the real time). If it finds an invalid clock, it will blink the display and post a message in the Herald window every fifteen seconds. If this happens, check your clock. If it looks ok, the time service is probably messed up. If your clock looks incorrect, you should reboot.You can stop the blinking mentioned above by unloading TimeTracker.~.
