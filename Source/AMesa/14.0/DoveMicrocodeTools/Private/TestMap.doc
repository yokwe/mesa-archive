--TestMap.docTestMap is an IOP hack that reads the virtual memory map of a Daybreak and checks that no 2 virtual pages point to the same real page.  It is run using IOPBermuda.  It keeps a count of errors and writes them up in an error table.  Loading TestMap kills the IOP as far as system operations go since it is located on top of some ram handlers.To use TestMap put a break at the place you want to check the map.  Make sure both the CP and the IOP are in their debugger kernels.  Load TestMap.loc using the Load! command in the IOPBermuda window.  This sets the CS:IP to the beginning of the test as well as loading the code.  Set an IOP break at TestOver.  Set data type to word.  Put TotalErrCnt in an IOP tile.  Put ErrorTable in a tile and Shift/Chord.  Bug Continue! in the IOP window.  Wait for the break to be taken at TestOver.  Depending on the number of vacant pages this takes 2 to 20 minutes with 23 bit VM.  If there any errors TotalErrCnt will give the number of errors.  The error table has 4 words of info on each error.  First the real page number which is doubly mapped.  Then comes both virtual pages which point to the doubly mapped real page.  Finally there is a word which is always 0.TestMap assumes a medium virtual memory map size of 23 bits.  It can be adapted for 22 or 24 bit VM by changing a couple of variables in TestMap's data region.  Here is how.  After loading set a break at ChangeVMSize.  Continue and take the break.  Put LastVirtPagePtrLo and LastVirtPagePtrHi in tiles in the IOP window.  They should show as FFFE and 2000.  For 24 bit VM change them to FFFE and 3000 respectively.  For 22 bit VM change them to 7FFE and 2000 respectively.  Then continue and the test will run as before.  If you are impatient like I am and want to know if any problems have been found yet and if the test is still working or not before it has finished, you can.  Stop the IOP.  It will almost certainly come up stopped at InnerLoop+n for some small value of n.  You can tell what kind of progress it is making by looking at the stack at this point.  The top two words on the stack are pointer to the word of the VMM currently being compared to the rest of the VMM.  They count up to 2000:FFFE for 23 bit VMM.  Because of the algorithm the count gets much faster as it gets near the end.  TotalErrCnt and ErrorTable are updated as errors are found so you can read them the same way as you would at the end of the test to see what has happened so far.There is one other feature.  TestMap keeps track of the largest mapped real page it finds in the variable MaxMappedPg.
