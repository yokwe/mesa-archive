MFileServer.doc--Nannette       21-Oct-86 10:46:31--AOF	          1-Jul-87 20:44:09XFileServer is an implementation which replaces NSDataStream with a prototype XStream.  It allows your workstation to act like a file server.  Thus, allowing other workstations to retrieve, list, store, and delete files on your workstation.  There are variables that can be set to restrict others from storing, overwriting, and deleting of your files.   These variables may be set in your user.cm or may be set when MFileServer starts (see below).   The variables are described below:Note: on = TRUE. off = FALSE.Running: is a boolean that controls whether the server will accept connections.  When it is FALSE, it will disallow further connections and will terminate the current connection. (default is TRUE)LogActivity: is a boolean that controls whether MFileServer logs its activity in its subwindow.  When it is FALSE, no log is kept. (default = TRUE).StoreAllowed:  is a boolean that controls whether store operations are allowed.  When it is FALSE, files may be retrieved but no files may be stored. (default is FALSE)DeleteAllowed: is a boolean that controls whether delete operations are allowed. When it is FALSE, files may not be deleted. (default is FALSE)OverWriteAllowed: is a boolean that controls whether existing files may be modified.  When it is FALSE, new files may be stored, but old files may not be overwritten. (default is FALSE)AccessList: is a user.cm entry which details who will have access to the files on your machine.  It takes the form "who:domain:organization".Examples:to run MFileServer from the exec-->MFileServerThis command can also be used to change the variables of the MFileServer by taking a series of arguments of the form variable/switch.  The acceptable switches are 'on' and 'off'.>MFileServer storeallowed/on deleteallowed/on overwriteallowed/on running/offThis will set storeallowed, deleteallowed, and overwriteallowed on and running off.When the variables are set in this way, they will overwrite the values which were set in the user.cm.The following switches may be set in your user.cm:[MFileServer]Running: TRUEStoreAllowed: FALSEOverWriteAllowed: FALSEDeleteAllowed: FALSE AccessList: "sdd-pilot:osbu south:xerox"All switches except running and logActivity is defaulted to False. Note:  The workstation you are trying to communicate with must be registered with the clearinghouse.  To do this send a message to SDSupport telling them that you want your workstation registered.  Include in your message your name and processsor ID.
