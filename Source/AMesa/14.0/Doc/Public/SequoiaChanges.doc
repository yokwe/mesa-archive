They are stored in the root directory.* Dove bootfiles are available on the release directory.* New User.cm entrie for Tajo:  [FileWindow]  Extensions: .mesa .config .cm .log .df .doc .<anything>TOOLSAdobe:  Several ARs have been fixed.  MailTool:  Private DLs are implemented.  NSTerminal: The user interface has been improved.  Delete your old <>TIP>Emulator.TIP before running the new version.  FTP:  The List/f and List/b commands, which never worked before, now work and have a syntax different from that described in the XUG.  Only one of the /f or /b switches may be used and it must be the last switch.  After one of these switches is seen, the rest of the command line is assumed to be a list of files.  The new syntax is as follows:  	> FTP List/f date-with-no-spaces <files>	> FTP List/f "date with spaces" <files>  The date may be in any valid format for dates.  The /f switch lists the files that have a create date after the date given.  The /b switch lists those files with a create date before the date given.     Example:  	> FTP RamRod Dir/c AMesa List/dalf 10-Oct-84 '*»»»» CHANGES FROM CALAVERAS TO SEQUOIA ««««PUBLIC INTERFACES:  No Mesa 11.1 public interfaces have been changed for 12.0.PUPLESS BOOTFILES:  Pups have been removed from all bootfiles, except PupOthello.  For TTYTajo this means you have to use Chat, not PupChat, to palaver with its RemoteExec. The "INSTALLING PUPS ON MESA 12.0" section in InstallSequoia.doc explains how to run Pups on a 12.0 bootfile.NEW TOOLS:  Several old protocol-based tools have generally been replaced by NS counterparts.  The Pup tools are also included as friends level tools on the release directory.    NS				Pup  Adobe			PupAdobe  Chat			PupChat  LibrarianTool		Access, LibrarianInterpreterTool  MailTool		Hardy  Maintain		PupMaintain  MFileServer		STPServer  RemoteExec		PupRemoteExec  SendTool		MailSendTool  Sequoia also brings you NSTerminal as a fully supported tool.  See documentation in the Network executive Tools chapter of the XUG.ADOBE:There is a new adobe system.  (The Adobe you all knew and loved is still around, now renamed to PupAdobe.) The Adobe systems System Software and ARTest have been converted to the new Adobe.  ARTest will continue to be available via PupAdobe, but System Software will not.  Other systems will be converted to the new Adobe at the convenience of users and implementors.  For those of you who need to use both the old and the new Adobes, you can run them simultaneously with no ill effects.Please read the new Adobe chapter, available as a STAR document, even if you are a sophisticated adobe user.  The major changes to Adobe are mentioned below.  Although the tool's appearance is very similar to the PupAdobe, the underlying mechanics are now very different.	Major changes to Adobe include:	The Librarian is no longer used by Adobe.  A new entity, the Adobe service, takes its place to serve the needs of the Adobe tools.  The Adobe service manages information about various Adobe systems.  Information regarding which Adobe service serves which Adobe systems is entered in the Clearinghouse.  The user need only specify the desired system name (which in some cases should be a fully-qualified name).  The tool will contact the proper service for the system you want.You no longer need .bcd files (field list files) to run systems.Adobe is now ONE tool, which may have multiple instances.  When you invoke Adobe, you get one window which will look very much like one of the old Adobe tools.  The initial type of tool may be specified in your User.cm entry (see chapter). You may change this tool from one type to another and create additional tools by invoking the Another! command from the uppermost command subwindow.  All tools are independent from one another so that if one is busy, you can still use the others; for example, you may query, examine and report all at the same time, cycles permitting.You are no longer limited to one querylist per system.  Any operation involving a querylist allows you to specify the name of the querylist to use.  Not specifying a querylist results in your old favorite, SysQL, being used.LIBRARIAN:    Sequoia includes a NS-based librarian, which runs on a DLion (as opposed to an Alto for the PUP librarian).  The following tools have been changed or replaced.- Access and LibrarianInterpreterTool have been replaced by a single tool called LibrarianTool. It is documented in the Project Management Tools section of the new manuals. Not all the functionality provided with the old set of tools is available through the LibrarianTool. Instead, these features are now provided through the DF Tools in conjunction with its use of the librarian.  The old LibrarianReportTool is no longer supported.- The DFTool uses the NS Librarian, not the PUP Librarian, as is documented in the DF Software Reference Manual.- The Prefix and Suffix fields of the Profile, set in the Librarian section of the User.cm, are ignored by the tools listed above,  but are being retained for future use. The Server: section is still used and refers to the librarian database name.EDITOR:  The editor's Match! command matches BEGINs & ENDs, DOs & ENDLOOPs, SELECTs & ENDCASEs, as well as [], {}, (), «», and <<>>.  It won't match [..), however.  New User.cm entries for the Editor:  [Editor]  Scope: all | rest | selection  Interpret: pattern | literal  Context: anywhere | words  IgnoreCase: FALSE | TRUE  ConfirmReplace: FALSE | TRUE  Level: 2EXECUTIVE:  The new commands Floppy.~ erase and Floppy.~ scavenge can be called from the executive.	TAJO:* To provide better performance with file services, identities are now authenticated at logon time, and may take several seconds to complete.  Feedback from the logon now appears in the HeraldWindow.* CommandCentral is no longer part of the CoPilot boot file.  You must retrieve and run CommandCentral.bcd from the alpha test directory.* There are new TIP tables for the Dove keyboard and for Tajo.  Boot with the "I" switch to get them the first time.* FileWindows.Save[] from the debugger saves Empty windows to a file named "ScratchWindows.saved" on your client volume.  You must have FileWindows.bcd on your disk to execute this command from the debugger.* ScratchSources.Save[] saves all scratch sources to a file named "ScratchSources.saved."  Unlike the previous command, this one saves your mail send windows as well as your Empty Windows, but doesn't save FileWindows that you were Editing.  You must have ScratchSources.bcd on your disk to use this command.* PROP'S-CR in a FileWindow will "unindent" one level.* A new SetPositionBalanceBeam affects the way text is displayed in your windows.  A new CaretShape switch selects between two different styles of carets.* You can specify a default font and default number of lines for Menu Symbiotes and a list of default extensions for FileWindows.  New User.cm entries for Tajo:    [System]  SetPositionBalanceBeam: top |  middle | topBottom  CaretShape: triangle | iBeam  [FileWindow]  MenuSymbioteFont: MenuSymbolsFont.strike  MenuSymbioteLines: 1See the SequoiaMissing.doc for a complete explanation of these features.DEBUGGER  The debugger has several new features as well as user.cm parsing.    1. To go backward in the stack, use "b" or "jump -n"  2. Relations are implemented ( =, #, >, <, >=, <= )  3. Real numbers and their operations are implemented  4. Hex numbers may be entered with an 'H or 'h suffix  5. To get concrete values of opaque types, use Attach Opaque. For example, >ATtach Opaque: Window.Object Filename: WindowImplBwill cause all Window.Object to be printed as WindowImplB$Object. The attachment remains in effect until a new session.The debugger now supports multiple remote debuggers.  Also, waiting for a remote debuggee no longer holds the notifier.  6.
