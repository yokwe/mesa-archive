This update fixes several problems.  There are no new functions, and interfaces have not changed.  To ensure full testing, please upgrade to 12.0b as soon as possible, including new boot files and tools.  As usual, please send trouble reports via the System Software Adobe (AR) system, specifying the version as 12.0b.WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATIONThe Alpha Test directory, [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>, has been updated. New Othello boot files will soon be available from boot servers in both Palo Alto and El Segundo.Sources and internal implementation details have been archived on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>.  The unchanged components (from Mesa 11.1) of Mesa 12.0 have been added to the archive directory.  DF's for components on the archive directory are on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>DF>.  The DF's for the 12.0a version of Sequoia are available on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0a>DF>.Stubs supplied in the boot files are based on and protocol-compatible with Services 8.0.  The following stubs are included:  NSFilingRemoteConfig.bcd, NSSessionImpl.bcd, NSStringConfig.bcd, NSStringConvertConfig.bcd, AuthStub.bcd, MailStubConfig.bcd, XComSoft.bcd.NSDataStreamConfig.bcd, temporarily part of the Pilot release, is also included.  So instead of running Filing.bcd (which contains NSDataStreamConfig), you should now run NSFilingConfig.bcd (which does not contain NSDataStreamConfig) for your local filing needs.  NSFilingConfig.bcd is available on the [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Temp> for your convenience.  Pup.bcd is also available on the Mesa Alpha Test directory, as a convenience to those needing Pups.If you do not already have the new fonts.widths, please retrieve it from the Alpha Test directory.  This includes widths of the new fonts for ns printers.Draft versions of the Librarian and Adobe service administrator's guides are now available on [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Doc>.  Please message (Becky) Fontes:OSBU North:Xerox with any suggestions or problems regarding the Librarian and Adobe service administrator's guides.ALPHA TEST SCHEDULEThe boot files in this update are built with the Pilot 12.0b PilotKernel.bcd.  A 12.0c update will happen shortly.  This update will include only boot files built with the 12.0c PilotKernel.bcd.We will continue to screen all ARs.

David Elliott".osbunorth's message of 16 May 85 09:52:35 PDT (Thursday)Are any of you aware of a problem with the initial microcode fetch in the 12.0b and 12.0c versions of PUPOthelloDLion.boot? If I'm not doing something in error I believe this is a showstopper.I set out to go 12.0 on a 42Mbyte volume using 12.0b PUPOthelloDlion.boot from floppy. The WS was originally formatted and partioned for 11.0. The LVs had to be recreated from scratch to get the larger Othello volume as opposed to simply updating existing volumes. After partitioning with 12.0b PUPOthello, I performed  an initial microcode fetch and 915'd after the file had been found, my confirmation requested and formatting of the initial file started. I tried the same operation with 12.0c and got the same result. I've verified that the problem is not specific to my workstation.ARs #7415 for 12.0b and 7419 for 12.0c have been submitted. Debug logs and other info is contained therein.I found that I could use 11.1 PUPOthello for the initial uCode fetch and and then continue with 12.0b (or 12.0c) for Germ, Pilot uCode and Bootfile fetches.I haven't tried building a WS with PUPOthello on a freshly formatted WS. Nor have I tried the NS only version of the file. I expect that being able to recreate a logical volume configuration and load software on an otherwise compatible disk format should work as well as doing likewise starting on a fresh format or updating existing volumes with sufficient capacity(ie an 11.1 to 12.0 conversion).	~~~HOSS~~~*start*01561 00071 US @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Sender: Linda Bergsteinsson:OSBU Bayshore:XeroxDate: 16 May 85 16:24:35 PDT (Thursday)Subject: Sequoia Release Readiness CommitteeFrom: elliott:OSBU NorthTo: bradshaw:OSBU South, irani:OSBU South, dknutsen:OSBU North, ladner:OSBU North, luniewski:OSBU North, racine:OSBU Northcc: desantis:OSBU South, lnelson:OSBU South, pike:OSBU North, beeson:OSBU South, coley:OSBU North, tomlinson:OSBU North, Sequoia:OSBU NorthReply-to: davirro:OSBU North, elliott:OSBU NorthWe would appreciate each of you in the To: list representing your section on the Sequoia Release Readiness Committee.

This update fixes several problems and adds the previously unsupported NSTerminal.  No public interfaces have been changed.  Boot files are built with the Pilot 12.0d PilotKernel.To ensure full testing, please upgrade to 12.0d as soon as possible, including new boot files, tools, and Adobe and Librarian services.  As usual, please send trouble reports via the System Software Adobe (AR) system, specifying the version as 12.0d.WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATIONThe system test directory [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0> has been updated. Documentation is on [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Doc>.  The following have been substantively changed: Adobe Tools chapter, Network Executive Tools (new NSTerminal section) chapter, and InstallSequoia.doc (slimmed down and better instructions for using Pups).  For administrators there is also a new Adobe Service Administrator's Guide.InstallSequoia.doc describes both how to upgrade from 12.0c and how to install Sequoia from earlier versions of Mesa.Sources and internal implementation details have been archived on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>.  DF's for components on the archive directory are on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>DF>.  The DF's for the 12.0c version of Sequoia are on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0c>DF>.  Due to space limitations, the files for other than the current and previous versions of Sequoia will periodically be expunged, unless a specific request is made to the release coordinators.  Users of older versions of 12.0 should upgrade their workstations to 12.0d as soon as possible.MAJOR CHANGESSequoiaChanges.doc details all changes for Sequoia.  In brief, the changes for this update are:1. To provide better performance with File Services, identities are now authenticated at logon time.  Feedback from logon now appears in the HeraldWindow.  (The performance improvements from Services 8.1, as Mark Gealy described in his crosstalk, were included in an earlier update.)  Also, FileTransfer performance has been improved.2. NSTerminal is now supported, as documented in the Network Executive Tools chapter.3. CommandCentral is no longer part of the Tajo and CoPilot boot files.  You must retrieve and run CommandCentral.bcd from the system test directory.4. PupConfig.bcd, available on the system test directory, is now the recommended way to run Pups, as described in "Installing PUPs on Mesa 12.0" in InstallSequoia.doc.  In particular, we recommend against running individual BCDs, which has proved to be error-prone.5. The debugger supports multiple remote debuggers.  Also, waiting for a remote debuggee no longer holds the notifier.  New debugger User.cm entries and the b command (move backwards in the stack) are included.SYSTEM TEST SCHEDULEThe Mesa and Pup releases are very stable.  No date is set for the next update.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SEQUOIA SHOWSTOPPERSThese are our initial assessments of each AR nominated by our clients as a Sequoia showstopper.  Each has been assessed as either fixed, a showstopper, a serious bug, rejected, or a non-Sequoia problem.  A "serious bug" is not currently a showstopper, but will be worked on and may become a showstopper.  A "non-Sequoia problem" is one that we do not plan to fix for Sequoia.These assuessments will be sent to and agreed upon with the XDE 4.0 Quality Assurance Team (nee Release Readiness Committee).    Showstoppers6480: System crash when adding self to a DL in Maintain when not7172: Adobe Query crashed when given large query7175: Command items cause crash if the tool is not using a system7228: crash in DateFileImpl from Edit7230: Get! and Submit! causes StringBoundsFault crash7239: Store/ua stores even when remote version is identical7254: Get File breaks Adobe7270: Adobe Edit crashes doing CheckOut7281: Crashed doing Examine on Adobe edit.7315: Store /ua on NS Fails: stores identical version7361: MailTool documentation7413: NSChat: uncaught ERROR in CourierImplU when RemoteExec7434: Mail Tool crashes when "Answer" is bugged7471: Address Fault in Adobe if no login until after started7498: Boundary Cases7510: Editing bad AR numbers7513: Adobe Report7540: Adobe Report => Crash with StringBoundsFault    Serious Bugs6022: Tinying window after aborting connection attempt hangs machine6037: StringBoundsFault in FileTool (long directory name)6195: StringBoundsFault attempting FileTool "Retrieve"6290: Long filenames6322: Character code 244C illegal6491: can't escape special characters such as * and \6673: Remote-delete causes crash6758: crash with space in Source6760: Print & Oldprint blow up on small current selection6889: File tool process ABORTED while talking to NS Server6963: uncaught ERROR on bogus file name6970: NS retrieve works in 11.0, fails in 11.17277: StringBoundsFault from long file name on FS7282: failure of store/overwrite7312: activate during Logon.~ => UNCAUGHT SIGNAL7356: unable to type search path in othello7379: Fails to set Interpress filetype on remote server7418: MailTool goes 915 during delivery if many edits made7432: Erroneously converts 'Helvetica' to 'Modern'7468: Print: Uncaught signal from MSegment7487: Can't scavenge without debugger7489: RemoteExec: Appears to hang following internet problems7508: Adobe phreaks out in Tajo????: Slow performance & vanishing disk pages    Fixed in 12.0a-d5825: Undistinguished CH names hurt performance with Services 8.06450: Deleting text when window split causes crash6638: Othello can't open NS connection: "invalid login"6723: Can't fetch initial microcode6724: Othello needs to start the CH6728: UG - NSOthello crashes6742: Othello Address Fault if fetching w/o setting directory6769: Brownie: Date comparison for update works incorrectly7209: Adobe on AlphaMesa: corresponding source files NOT ON7232: OR with empty 2nd operand Address faults in HeapImpl7241: Adobe bug: Another! => Address Fault7303: Unc Error in Addr Translation7355: Back to Back Submits => 2nd AR has screwed up arId field7364: Othello: Initial uCode Fetch breaks with System Error7407: AddrFault in TextDisplaysA on startup displaying "No Route7500: Run Adobe when not logged in => crash7515: PupAdobe must start Pup7516: PupChat must start Pup7517: PupMaintain must start Pup	Rejected6789: Attempt to retrieve NS document crashes system -- superseded by AR 67177003: uncaught ERROR when I use mfileserver -- declined, not enough informationThe Mesa Implementors*start*02379 00071 US @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Sender: Bruce A.

This would require all DFs and command files pointing to this directory to be changed.2)	Move <AMesa>12.0> to another file service. This would require all DFs and command files pointing to this directory to be changed.3)	Keep no more than two version of 12.0 in <AMesa>12.0> at any one time. This would force implementors to use the current version of the system.We will implement whichever alternative is the least painful for you collectively. Our understanding of your needs is that is the third alternative.We must act before the next update.

Adobe ARs are stored on file services.  The Adobe tool gets the file service address from the Adobe service.  If the service has an invalid file service address, the Adobe tool will put out a message, "File service unavailable or down."  We are investigating this problem and we have a work around to correct this problem on the service.   However, after the service has the correct address, you must unload and restart Adobe for it to get the new address. I will send out a message whenever we have to correct the service's addresses.If you have been having trouble accessing systemsoftware, unload and restart Adobe.

This update fixes several problems and includes daybreak boot files.  No public interfaces have been changed.  This update is based on the Pilot 12.0g update.To ensure full testing, please upgrade to 12.0e as soon as possible, including new boot files, tools, and Adobe and Librarian services.  As usual, please send trouble reports via the System Software Adobe (AR) system, specifying the version as 12.0e.WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATIONThe system test directory [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0> has been updated. Documentation is on [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Doc>.  InstallSequoia.doc describes how to upgrade from 12.0d and how to install Sequoia from earlier versions of Mesa.Sources and internal implementation details have been archived on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>.  DF's for components on the archive directory are on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>DF>.  The DF's for the 12.0d version of Sequoia are on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0d>DF>.  Due to space limitations, the files for other than the current and previous versions of Sequoia will periodically be expunged, unless a specific request is made to the release coordinators.  Users of older versions of 12.0 should upgrade their workstations to 12.0e as soon as possible.MAJOR CHANGESSequoiaChanges.doc details all changes for Sequoia.  In brief, the changes for this update are:1.  This update includes the following daybreak boot files:  CoPilotDove.boot, TajoDove.boot, PupOthelloDove.boot, OthelloDove.boot, and DiagEtherDove.boot.DiagEtherDove.boot is the Offline Ethernet Diagnostics.  This boot file currently does not fit on a floppy.  Diagnostics include echo tests, internal and external loop-back tests, ethernet chip self-tests, time domain reflection test, and interface tests.  Error logging and command trace logs are maintained.  The user interface uses the standard offline diagnostic menus and prompting.  Documentation is not yet available.2.  This update includes Acceptance Test Program (ATP), a package designed to stress Dandelion and Daybreak machines for manufacturing.  ATP includes the following programs and documentation:  ATControlMaster.bcd, ATInstallSlaveDLion.boot, ATTestSlaveDLion.boot, ATControlMasterDove.bcd, ATInstallSlaveDove.boot, ATTestSlaveDove.boot, and ATPUser.doc.3.  Several Adobe bugs have been fixed. 4.  You can use the Installer to retrieve data files for Tajo and CoPilot. Use the Installer's Data command to retrieve files to the desired volume. SYSTEM TEST SCHEDULEThe Mesa and Pup releases are very stable.  No date is set for the next update.  Boot files based on Pilot 12.0h will appear soon on <AlphaMesa>12.0>Temp>.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SEQUOIA SHOWSTOPPERSThese are our initial assessments of each AR nominated by our clients as a Sequoia showstopper.

Only the latest Adobe.bcd will communicate with the new Adobe service.2.  A bug in CoPilot that prevented the Spy performance tool from working was fixed.3.  MailTool polling has been changed to reduce the load on the Clearinghouse. 4.  Several Adobe bugs have been fixed. SYSTEM TEST SCHEDULEBased upon the current belief that Pilot 12.0k will be the final Yuba update, the final Sequoia update is scheduled for 1 November.  We expect this to include only changes to Adobe and bootfiles.SEQUOIA SHOWSTOPPERSThe XDE 4.0 Quality Assurance Team met and agreed upon the following remaining showstoppers for Sequoia.

Saaranzin:OSBU North:XeroxDate: 20 Mar 85 16:17:12 PST (Wednesday)Subject: Entry to Sequoia Alpha TestFrom: SaaranzinTo: SequoiaReply-to: elliott, saaranzinThe Mesa 12.0 and Pup 12.0 releases, known jointly as Sequoia, are now available for Alpha Test.  This first update, named after the dominant release, is Mesa 12.0a.  Sequoia, built on Pilot 12.0, is scheduled to remain in Alpha Test until right after Pilot 12.0 is released.If you are already running Calaveras, you need to do little more than fetch new boot files and some tools.  To ensure full testing of the software, it is important that all Sequoia Alpha Testers upgrade to 12.0a as soon as possible, including new boot files, BCDs, and tools.This message contains eight parts.  CHANGES FOR SEQUOIA describes how Sequoia differs from Calaveras (Mesa 11.1).  WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE and WHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATION identify the locations of the software and documentation, respectively, for this release.  CONVERTING TO SEQUOIA describes how to convert your workstation to a Sequoia system; if you have not previously converted to Calaveras, you should carefully read the Calaveras documentation and first convert your workstation to Calaveras.  HARDWARE REQUIRED describes the lack of changes to the supported hardware configurations.  COEXISTING WITH STAR provides advice on running both Sequoia and released versions of Star on your workstation.  SCHEDULE AND INFORMATION gives the schedule for Sequoia Alpha test and describes the Sequoia distribution list, Sequoia:OSBU North:Xerox.  PROBLEMS AND AR'S describes how to submit trouble reports against the Mesa 12.0 software and documentation.  CHANGES FOR SEQUOIASequoiaChanges.doc details the changes for Sequoia.  In brief, they are:1. Mesa 12.0 provides product Mesa services and tools, including NS-based Adobe, Librarian, MFileServer, mail tools, and network executive tools.Librarian and Adobe services support the Adobe and Librarian tools.  Documentation for the tools are now available; System Administrator's Guides for the services will be available later in Alpha test.  Administrators interested in installing these services before then, please contact Becky Saaranzin <Saaranzin:osbu north> or Joyce Sawai <Sawai:osbu north>.2. Although support for tools and services based on old protocols will be discontinued in a future release (not the next one), one cannot simply abandon old (reliable) friends.  These tools remain released and will be supported as time allows.Old protocol-based tools have been renamed to avoid confusion with their NS counterparts:  NS				Pup  Adobe			PupAdobe  Chat			PupChat  LibrarianTool		Access, LibrarianInterpreterTool  MailTool		Hardy  Maintain		PupMaintain  MFileServer		STPServer  RemoteExec		PupRemoteExec  SendTool		MailSendToolPups have been removed from all bootfiles (except PupOthelloDLion.boot).  Old protocol-based tools require that you first load the Pup stubs, as described in the INSTALLING PUPS ON MESA 12.0 section in InstallSequoia.doc.3. Tajo has been changed only as needed to support Dove (new keyboard and display size).Otherwise, there is no new function, and interfaces are (by design) unchanged.WHERE TO GET SOFTWAREAll software can be found on the Alpha Test directory.  This directory is flat: it has no subdirectories except a Doc> subdirectory:	[Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>	                              12.0>Doc>The archive directory will eventually contain all files contributing to Sequoia.  After the 12.0a update, only the changed components will be on the archive directory; the unchanged components will be added in 12.0b.  Like Calaveras, there are not separate subdirectories on the archive directory for particular updates.  Rather, the highest version numbered file on this directory is always the file for the latest update to Sequoia Alpha Test.  This directory is not flat, but has a structure convenient for the Mesa implementors (the same general structure as for the Mesa 11.0 and 11.1 releases).  The archive directory (with its DF> subdirectory) is:	[Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>	                          12.0>DF>WHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATIONSince little has changed since Calaveras, the Sequoia documentation assumes the baseline Calaveras documentation.  Documentation describing Sequoia is on:	[Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Doc>Sequoia documentation includes:	SequoiaChanges.doc	SequoiaRestrictions.doc	InstallSequoia.doc	Sequoia Missing documentation	(To avoid unnecessary editing, most documentation refers to the public directory <Mesa> rather than to <AlphaMesa>.)SequoiaChanges.doc describes the changes from Mesa 11.1 and gives the few conversion tips needed to convert from 11.1 to 12.0.SequoiaRestrictions.doc lists known restrictions (and work arounds) for Mesa 12.0.InstallSequoia.doc describes how to convert a workstation from Calaveras to Sequoia.12.0 Missing documentation, a Star document, lists documentation missing from the Mesa 12.0 release.Sequoia documentation also includes the following new chapters of the XUG in draft form along with their associated Interpress files.  Please submit ARs against these chapters using the System Software Adobe System, or drop off marked up hardcopies. 	Mesa services intro	Adobe tools	Librarian tool	Mail tools	MFileServer	NetworkExec tools CONVERTING TO SEQUOIAInstallSequoia.doc describes how to convert your workstation to Sequoia. Mesa 12.0 Othello (PupOthelloDLion.boot) will soon be available in the Bayhill and EP buildings in Palo Alto and in the CP-10 building in El Segundo as a "6" boot.  Mesa 11.1 Othello is available from the Ethernet as a "3" boot.  Other sites need to fetch the boot files from the Alpha Test directory and change both the FetchBootServerDLionFiles.cm command file and the [BootServer] section of the gateway text file; network administrators with further questions on this should contact Ted Manley (TManley.PA, 8*923-4642, Palo Alto).Programs and interfaces developed for Calaveras need not be recompiled for Sequoia except as noted in the Pilot 12.0 Change Summary (on [Huey:OSBU North]<AlphaPilot>12.0>Doc).HARDWARE REQUIREDNo changes to Dandelion hardware are needed to run Sequoia.  Like Klamath and Calaveras, version 3.0 EPROMs (or later) are needed to boot from the Ethernet, and Sequoia supports neither 384K byte machines with an LF display nor Dolphins. COEXISTING WITH STARSequoia is compatible with OS 5.0, including Star.  However, the Pilot 12.0 microcode includes a new TextBlt operation that is incompatible with OS 5.0.  For that reason, OS 5.0 Star must be booted with the 'T switch (use software TextBlt) to run on Pilot 12.0 microcode.SCHEDULE AND INFORMATIONSequoia Alpha Test is planned to last one week after Pilot 12.0 System Test.  Barring catastrophe, no public interfaces will be recompiled during Alpha Test.  Updates will be done as needed during alpha test.Information to Alpha Test clients is sent via the NS distribution list Sequoia:OSBU North.  If you know of anyone who should be on this list (or if you should not be), please send a message to Sawai:OSBU North.  All mail to Sequoia will be accumulated and stored as	[Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Doc>Sequoia.nsMailPROBLEMS AND AR'SPlease submit all problem reports using the new Mesa 12.0 Adobe Tool using the System Software Adobe System, specifying the version (such as 12.0a) and the hardware (such as Dandelion or Daybreak).  It helps speed attention to the problem if the subject line begins with the name of the subsystem involved in the problem reported.The AR Database is our main tool for tracking the many problem reports that we receive during Alpha Test.  We also depend on patterns of problems reported in AR's to develop a global picture of the state of the system and of the progress of Alpha Test.AFTER submitting an AR, feel free to contact the implementor by message, by phone, or in person.  We can only guarantee attention, however, to problems documented in AR's.  Moreover, you can more effectively achieve change if you remember the harried implementor's first defense:	"If there is no AR, there is no problem."The Mesa Implementors*start*01378 00071 UUm@00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Sender: W.

If this is true for you, here is a simple procedure for providing yourself with the required Pup support in an XDE 12.0 environment.Fetch the following files from the release directory:  Pup.bcd STPs.bcd PupFileTransfers.bcd GrapevineUser.bcd TajoLibrarians.bcd OldTajoLibrarians.bcdNOTE: At the time of this writing, Pup.bcd had not yet been stored on the release directory. Until it is, you may get it from  [Huey:OSBU North:Xerox]<APilot>12.0>Pup>Friends>Pup.bcdChange the InitialCommand line of your User.cm's [System] section to include them e.g.[Tajo:System]...InitialCommand: Run.~ ... Pup.bcd/l STPs.bcd/l PupFileTransfers.bcd/l GrapevineUser.bcd/l TajoLibrarians.bcd/l OldTajoLibrarians.bcd/l ......Caution: The order of the files in the Run line is important. Starting these files in a different order or leaving some of them out may cause you problems.If you include PupAdobe in your IntitialCommand, put it after these Pup support routines.That's all it takes.	Dale*start*01692 00071 US @00045 01536 ftffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@Sender: Dana C.

No public interfaces have been changed.  Only boot files, the Adobe tool, and Adobe service have changed for this update.  This update is based on the Pilot 12.0 release.WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATIONThe system test directory [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0> has been updated.The permanent product directory location will be given in the release message, due soon.Documentation is on [Goofy:OSBU North]<AlphaMesa>12.0>Doc>.  All messages sent to the system testers of this release have been collected and stored as Sequoia.nsMail.Sources and internal implementation details have been archived on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>.  DF's for components on the archive directory are on [Ramrod:OSBU North]<AMesa>12.0>DF>.  All previous versions of Sequoia will be deleted soon.MAJOR CHANGESThere are no major changes for this update.  SequoiaChanges.doc details all changes for Sequoia.  InstallSequoia.doc describes how to upgrade from earlier versions of Sequoia and how to install Sequoia from earlier versions of Mesa.SEQUOIA SHOWSTOPPERSThis update fixes all remaining showstoppers, as agreed upon by the XDE 4.0 Quality Assurance Team.We would like to thank all our system testers (with a special nod to the XDE 4.0 Quality Assurance Team).
