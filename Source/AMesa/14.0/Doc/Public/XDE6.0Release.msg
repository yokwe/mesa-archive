Sender: Holly Wanless:OSBU North:XeroxDate:  9 Mar 89 11:26:03 +0900 (Thursday)Subject: XDE 6.0 Release Message (LONG MSG)From: XDEConsultantsTo: MesaUsers:All Areascc: LMaher, Herz, Luckman:OSBU:RX, GT:OSBU:RXReply-to: XDEConsultants:All AreasXDE 6.0 has completed system and Beta test and is now officially released. This is essentially the same software that is sent to the University Grant sites and commercial customers, but this message only concerns the internal version of the release. Please upgrade as soon as possible, since support for earlier releases cannot be guaranteed indefinitely.XDE 6.0 consists of:	 Mesa 14.0	 Pilot 14.0	 ViewPoint 2.0 (BWS 4.3.1) programming interfaces and tools	 C 14.0  (Commercial Languages)	 Arpa (TCP/IP) 14.0 In addition to the above components, XDE 6.0 is primarily dependent on Services 8.0, containing the Services 8.0 interfaces and communication stubs, with the exceptions of   1) Mailing, which depends on Services 8.2 interfaces and stubs   2) a modified version of the Services 8.0.12 Filing Stub.New features for this release include the demise of the CoPilot debugger and bootfile, the exclusive use of Sword (same-world debugger), MDS (main data space) relief, support for cartridge tape, enhancements to the TCP/IP interfaces and tools, expansions to the ViewPoint Document interfaces, and new interfaces to the following ViewPoint applications: Pro Illustrator, Converter, Terminal Emulations.Complete documentation of new features is found in the documents listed underWHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATION.This message has 6 parts:WHERE TO GET SOFTWAREWHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATION & TRAINING MATERIALSHARDWARE REQUIREDBUG REPORTSQUESTIONSUNSUPPORTED SOFTWARE (HACKS)1.  WHERE TO GET SOFTWARE:1.1  Release directories for XDE 6.0 are:  a.  Mesa 14.0:      [BitBucket:OSBU North:Xerox]<Mesa>14.0> - Mesa 14.0 microcode,          bootfiles, tools and related files; source and object files	  for Mesa interfaces.         b.  Pilot 14.0:      [BitBucket:OSBU North:Xerox]<Pilot>14.0> - Pilot 14.0 microcode,          bootfiles, tools and related files; source and object files	  for Pilot interfaces.          c.  BWS 4.3.1 (no release directory; use archive directory):      [UH:OSBU South:Xerox]  	  <ABasicWS>4.3.1>Public>    - VP 2.0 bootfile	            4.3.1>Data >     - data files	  <ABasicWS>4.3>Public>      - public interfaces & tools		          d. ViewPoint 2.0 Application Interfaces:      [Bitbucket:OSBU North:Xerox]<VPApplDefs>2.0>       -- Interfaces to the VP Document Editor, Illustrator graphics,	  Terminal Emulator, Converter, Cusp Buttons, Equations, charts	  and tables, etc.               e.  TCP/IP (Arpa) tools and protocols       [Bitbucket:OSBU North:Xerox]<Arpa>14.0>  -- Arpa tools; source	     and object files for interfaces          f.  CommercialLanguages (C and Fortran):		This release is different from most internal	releases because we must charge for some of the software.  	The basis for the Commercial Language tools is the Portable C	Compiler and other software from the Berkeley 4.2 Software	Distribution, derived in turn from AT&T software.  Xerox'	agreement with AT&T requires that we submit quarterly reports	giving the number of copies of the sublicensed product that we 	have furnished to customers or put into use on our own CPU's during	the quarter being reported.  Xerox must pay a $60 royalty for each	copy of the product.		To receive the commercial language products you must first agree	to the conditions of the AT&T sublicensing agreement and submit a 	budget center transfer agreement for the $60 per copy royalty. 		The agreement & instructions can be found on:	    [Hal:OSBU North:Xerox]<XDE Public>	        CommercialLanguagesTransferAgreement.ip        	Retrieve and print this agreement, fill it out, have it signed by	someone with budget center authority, and return it to Linda Maher	at Mail Stop SV403. Once your transfer agreement has been received,	you will be given access to            [Bitbucket:OSBU North:Xerox]<CommercialLanguages>14.0>        If you paid the royalty fee during the XDE 5.0 release, you will	automatically have access to the XDE 6.0 version of C. You do not	need to pay the royalty fee twice.1.2  Archive directories for XDE 6.0 are:   a.  Mesa 14.0:       [Peabody:OSBU North:Xerox]<AMesa>14.0>  - implementation files used		to develop Mesa 14.0       				<AMesa>14.0>DF>  - DFs describing Mesa 14.0          b.  Pilot 14.0:       [Dino:OSBU North:Xerox]<APilot>14.0> - implementation files used		 to develop Pilot 14.0			      <APilot>14.0>DF> - DFs describing Pilot 14.0          c.  BWS 4.3.1:       [UH:OSBU South:Xerox]<ABasicWS>4.3> - implementation files used       		 to develop BWS 4.3.1       			    <ABasicWS>4.3.1>DF> - DFs describing BWS 4.3.1       d.  ViewPoint 2.0 Application Defs:          [Princeton:OSBU South:Xerox]<ABasicDocs>3.0>  - sources for 	 	ViewPoint Document interfaces (DocInterchangeDefs, etc.) 		       [Pitzer:OSBU South:Xerox]<AFC>2.0>	- source and object files        		for Converter interfaces		       [Pitzer:OSBU South:Xerox]<AEmTTY>2.0>	- source and object files        		for Terminal emulator interfaces       [Columbia:OSBU South:Xerox]<AIllustrator>2.0>Public>  - sources and       		symbols for IllustratorInterchangeDefs   e.  CommercialLanguages        [Odie:OSBU North:Xerox]<APCC>14.0>  and  <APCC>14.0>DF>       -- see above section on CommercialLanguages for access restriction       -- There is a separate & very expensive fee that must be paid for          access to the source code. See Jerry <Swick:OSBU North:Xerox>	  for details.      f.  TCP/IP and Arpa tools and protocols          [Odie:OSBU North:Xerox]<AArpa>14.0>     - 14.0 Arpa tools and		interface implementations				AArpa>14.0>DF>    - 14.0 Arpa DFs	           1.3  Dependent software:      XDE 6.0 is dependent on Services 8.0, plus the Pilot version of the     Services 8.0.12 Filing stub, which was included for compatibility with    the Filing 5 protocol.  The Services 8.2 Mailing interfaces and stubs are     also used in XDE 6.0.        Symbols for Services components are on:    [UCB:OSBU South:Xerox]<AServices>8.0> and [Dino:OSBU North:Xerox]<APilot>14.0>.    If you are trying to debug Pilot/Mesa software, you should use the DFs on    APilot to tell you where to get the correct modules, because some Services    components were recompiled by the Pilot group and version mismatches will    occur if you use the wrong versions.2.  WHERE TO GET DOCUMENTATION & TRAINING MATERIALS: 2.1. Ordering Manuals      You may print your own documentation if you wish, but to save printer wear,   time, expense, and trouble, we encourage you to order printed & bound copies   from Linda Maher, <LMaher:OSBU North:Xerox>. She will supply you with   the manuals you need and charge the cost to your budget center. You may   order complete manuals (in binders) or, for the XDE User Guide and the   Mesa Language Manual, you may also order just the 6.0 update package   (shrink-wrapped chapters, no binder).      To order manuals, retrieve & print the following transfer agreement, fill it   out, have it signed by someone with budget center authority, and return it   to Linda Maher at mail stop SVHQ 403. The transfer agreement is located   as both an interpress master and ViewPoint document on:	[Hal:OSBU North:Xerox]<XDE Public>	    XDE6.0DocumentationTransferAgreement.ip	    XDE 6.0 Documentation Transfer Agreement		 2.2. Updating Manuals      For those of you who are updating XDE 5.0 manuals (Fall 1986), there   is a document called       6.0DocumentationChanges.doc       6.0DocumentationChanges.ip   -- Interpress master   on [Bitbucket:OSBU North:Xerox]<Documentation>Release 6.0>   which describes changes to the documentation for XDE 6.0.  It will help   you decide which chapters you need to print in order to update your   existing manuals, or if ordering complete new manuals would be easier. 2.3.

HARDWARE REQUIRED    	No changes to Dandelion or Daybreak hardware are needed to run XDE 6.0.        For Dandelions, version 3.0 EPROMs (or later) however, are needed to boot        from the Ethernet.	Users should have IOP EPROMs version 6.0 dated 17-Sep-85 14:56:18 PDT for	a 6085 B0/B1 machine and 1-Oct-85 13:38:14 PDT for a B2 machine.	B2 machines can be distinguished by the expansion connector to be	found on the back side on the MPB (C3) board.  There is no connector	on the MPB boards of B0 or B1 machines.		TCP/IP Users: 6085s manufactured before approximately Sept. 1986	cannot receive odd length ethernet packets without a change of EPROMs. 	The part numbers of the new EPROMs, which can now be ordered, are	537E01651 and 537E01661.   	As for earlier releases, XDE 6.0 supports neither 384K byte machines with	an LF display nor Dolphins. 4.
