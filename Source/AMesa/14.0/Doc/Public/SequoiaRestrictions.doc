See the Pilot 12.0 restrictions document for known problems in the Pilot 12.0 release.TAJO>	If you fill up your disk on a development environment volume, it may not boot. There are several work-arounds for this situation. The best solution is to boot a development environment volume (Tajo or CoPilot) of the same or a higher type, open the full volume for writing via the "OpenVolume.~ volumeName/w" command, and delete files. If the full volume contains a CoPilot, you can generate free space by installing a Tajo boot file, which is considerably smaller. If necessary, you can retrieve a boot file onto a volume that doesn't normally contain the development environment, delete the files from the full volume, and then restore the volume to its original boot file. If you cannot do this for some reason, consult your local support group, who can provide you with a smaller boot file for scavenging.>	TIP:  If you are creating TIP tables, you should make sure that the ENTER or EXIT productions do not come first in the table. Otherwise, they may trigger a bug in the Notifier that will cause it to lock up.   >	Do not invoke Supervisor.NotifyAllSubsystems from Tajo or CoPilot. (You may invoke it in other environments).>	FileTransfer:  ReadStream with StreamType = temporary is not implemented for ns file services.   >	Do not use the "Power Off" command from the Exec Ops menu.>	Changing the current selection while running a program that takes its input from the current selection (such as Print $$$) can cause an address fault.TOOLS>	Executive:  There is a bug in the Executive command look-up algorithm; it does not distinguish between failure to find a command because there is no command that matches the command prefix and failing because there are too many commands (the prefix is ambiguous). As a result, if you type a non-unique prefix, the Executive may try to load one of those programs again. (Please see the description of command line interpretation in the Executive chapter of the XUG for the exact steps taken by the Executive if it cannot find the requested command.) You will then have several instances of the program loaded, and your command prefix will still not be unique. To avoid this bug, use only unique prefixes. If one command is a prefix of another command, you may have to include the ".~" at the end of the command. For example, if you have two commands, Copy.~ and Copy2.~, the prefix Copy is not unique. The only way to invoke the first command is by typing Copy.~. You can alleviate aggravating instances with the use of the Executive's AliasCommand.~ and ChangeCommandName.~ commands. AR 11211, 13609, 13666, 13667, 13684.   >	MakeDLionBootFloppyTool:  There is a bug in changing the installed bootfile on a floppy.   The workaround is to reformat the floppy and reinstall the germ as well as the new bootfile.  This requires a germ to be supplied whenever a new bootfile is put onto a floppy.>	Performance Tools:  while setting up the Perf Tool, newing or unnewing modules will cause a crash with an address fault.
