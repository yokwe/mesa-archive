I.e. it will make the selection lower case, and if shifted it will make the selection upper case.  If you are interested in other differences between the Dove and Dandelion keyboards, see the Pilot Change Summary.>	PROP'S-CR will "unindent" one level.  For example, you can type it instead of a CR when you want to close a scope on the next line.>	FileWindows.Save[] from the debugger saves Empty windows to a file named "ScratchWindows.saved" on your client volume.  You will need FileWindows.bcd on your debugger volume to use this command from the debugger.>	ScratchSources.Save[] saves all scratch sources to a file named "ScratchSources.saved."  Unlike the previous command, this one saves your mail send windows as well as your Empty Windows, but doesn't save FileWindows that you were Editing. You will need ScratchSources.bcd on your debugger volume to use this command from the debugger.>	A SetPositionBalanceBeam will affect the way text is displayed in your windows.  When you do a FIND or Position in a window, the position in question will be displayed at the top of the window in "top" mode (the way Tajo has always worked), in the middle in "middle" mode, or at either the top or bottom, which ever is more convenient, in "topBottom" mode.  TopBottom mode minimizes the repainting needed when you jump between various positions in the window.  Top mode only saves repainting when jumping backwards.  Middle mode doesn't save much at all, but it always positions things of interest in the middle of your window.  Top mode is the default.  Sample User.cm entry:	[System]	SetPositionBalanceBeam: top |  middle | topBottom>	A CaretShape switch selects between two different styles of carets.  The default is "triangle," which gives you the standard Tajo TextSW and TTYSW carets.  With caretShape = IBeam, however, you get an I-Beam caret in TextSWs and a gray rectangle in TTYSWs.  The switch is settable from the System section of your User.cm.	[System]	CaretShape: triangle | iBeam>	MenuSymbiotes can have their own font.  You can specify what font you want them to have in the FileWindow section of your User.cm.  The file name should have the .strike extension on it.  The file should be on your root directory, <>, so the system is assured of finding it even before your search path is set up.  An interesting font to use in your MenuSymbiotes is MenuSymbolsFont.strike on [Rasp:OSBU North:Xerox]<Fonts>.  Read MenuSymbolsFont.doc on the same directory for a description of the font.  You can also specify how many lines you would like your MenuSymbiotes to be.  It's not as easy as 1, 2, 3.  The MenuSymbiotsLines field in your User.cm can be a real number (e.g. 2.37).  It may take a few tries to get the MenuSymbiotes looking just the way you want them to. Sample User.cm entry:	[FileWindow]	MenuSymbioteFont: MenuSymbolsFont.strike	MenuSymbioteLines: 1>	When you hit DoIt in a FileWindow several default extensions are tried.  These defaults (.mesa .config .cm) can be changed by specifying a list of extensions in FileWindow sections of your User.cm.  Any string starting with a '.' is allowed.  For Example:	[FileWindow]	Extensions: .mesa .config .cm .doc .df .log  >	J.Last positions the last line of the file in the middle of your window (even if you don't have SetPositionBalanceBeam = middle).>	If the Notifier is busy and is not taking any page faults, Shift-STOP will not take you to the debugger. In this situation, use Shift-Shift-STOP to get to the debugger. If you must do this, you will not be able to execute Interpret-Calls from the debugger.  >	When chording the mouse buttons to bring up a menu, we recommend that you release the POINT (=left=red) button as soon as you have brought up the menu successfully.  The menu will stay up as long as you hold down the ADJUST button. Address faults may occur if you release the ADJUST button before releasing the POINT button when using menus. >	Avoid running Othello, Tajo, or CoPilot with extremely full volumes. Tools can fail in particularly ungraceful ways otherwise. >	Boot switches:  Three boot switches have been added to set the parameters of the system zone.         '[  tiny      initial: 4 pages, increment: 4 pages, large node: 128	'%  standard  initial: 40 pages, increment: 20 pages, large node: 260	']  large     initial: 100 pages, increment: 50 pages, large node: 260	The largest size specified by switches is the one used.  If no switch is specified the default switch '% is used.  Four page uniform swap units are used throughout. Reminder: the 'I boot switch causes all TIP tables to be re-initialized, i.e., the switch causes all existing .TIP files to be ignored, and new ones written as they are needed.	  >	NEXT and NEXT-DELETE search from the insertion point, not the selection.>	FileSystem:  If some tool in CoPilot gives the message that it could not close a volume, try to figure out why the volumeAboutToClose was aborted and rectify the situation, then close the volume manually by using the Exec's CloseVolume command. If you still cannot close the volume, you must reboot yourself before you try to proceed to the client. Reminder: if you open your client volume, or any volume readable from your client volume, for write, you must not proceed your client. >	If you go to the debugger and you want to save files, retrieve TajoTools.symbols from the release directory (contrary to the XUG appendix). AR 2170.EXECUTIVE:>	The commands Floppy.~ erase and Floppy.~ scavenge can be called from the executive.>	There are new built-in Exec commands.  Protect.~ changes the protection status of files and directories.  Registry.~ sets the default registry. Clearinghouse.~ sets the default domain and organization.  The user must execute the Login command after the Clearinghouse command in order to update the Clearinghouse of the logged in user.  Type "Help.~ <command>" to the Executive for further documentation.      >	In trying to re-execute a command to the Executive by selecting and stuffing a previous command, you may accidentally select the prompt character '>'. If so, the command that the Executive will try to run will start with the character > and will not match any of the registered commands. However, it will match the corresponding file when the Executive tries its autoload heuristic, causing the Executive to load another instance of your bcd. AR 2528TOOLS>	Compare: ignores more than 5120 lines of a file. >	MakeDLionBootFloppyTool:  now has an option to allow the user to reserve the last cylinder for diagnostics.  The user interface has changed slightly.  The command formSW has changed to contain three booleans and a command:  Format   ReserveLastCylinderForDiagnostics  InstallFiles   Start!  After selecting the desired options, the user selects Start! >	Brownie:o  Accepts the /q switch on the command line indicating that Brownie should query the user for login credentials. If /-q is specified, credentials will be taken from the profile.  /q is the default.  Example:	Brownie CopyArchive.brownie/-qo  Non-XDE files will NOT be transferred reliably from NS file servers.  In particular, long file names, non-standard file types (such as Viewpoint file types), and multi-segmented files (such as Viewpoint documents) are not supported.>	FTP:The List/f and List/b commands have a syntax different from that described in the XUG.  Only one of the /f or /b switches may be used and it must be the last switch.  After one of these switches is seen, the rest of the command line is assumed to be a list of files.  The new syntax is as follows:  	> FTP List/f date-with-no-spaces <files>	> FTP List/f "date with spaces" <files>The date may be in any valid format for dates.  The /f switch lists the files that have a create date after the date given.  The /b switch lists those files with a create date before the date given.   Example:  	> FTP RamRod Dir/c AMesa List/dalf 10-Oct-84 '*>	Command Central and the Run.~ and Load.~ commands of the Executive now recognize the v switch, which causes version mismatches to be ignored. >	Formatter: you can specify the font to use on the command line. For example    > Formatter /-tikg Souvenir/f Def.mesa Impl.mesaThe 'f' switch says that this is a font. It should come after the global switches and before any files to be formatted. Note that no size is given, just the name of the font. The formatter picks 10pt. for portrait and 8pt. for landscape. There are also new User.cm entries for the formatter:   [Formatter]   LandscapeFont: Souvenir   PortraitFont: Classic>	IncludeChecker:The /k (Output Packager Command) switch writes Packager commands in the output file that make Packager source and object files consistent (default TRUE).>	MakeBoot:Makeboot contains some new options and some old options have been removed.   The GFT entry is obsolete in the bootmesa file.  The gftLength command lineargument is also obsolete.   In the bootmesa file the options:    LOADSTATEMODULES: number    LOADSTATEBCDS: numberare now available.  These items set the number of empty module and bcd slots you would like to have in the initial LoadState.  Such entries are used when, for instance, modules are loaded or NEW'ed.  This number does not include the modules and bcds in the boot file.  In the command line, the options:    lsModules: number    lsBcds: numberare now available.  These items override the numbers in the parameter file given by LOADSTATEMODULES and LOADSTATEBCDS, respectively.  They have the same meaning as LOADSTATEMODULES and LOADSTATEBCDS, respectively.  Since Pilot will automatically expand the loadstate as necessary, these numbers are optional and need not be particularly accurate. The /u switch may be added to the MakeBoot command for UtilityPilot-based bootfiles.  This switch has no effect on program execution but makes the bootfile smaller by eliminating unnecessary data. With multiple bootmesa files, the last file takes precedence for all parameters except lsModules, lsBcds, and processes, in which cases the first bootmesa file takes precedence.  Parameters on the command line override those in a bootmesa file. Also, MakeBoot will take "\nnn" boot switches in its command line if they are enclosed in double quotes, such as:MakeBoot OthelloTriDLion[parm: UtilityPilot, parm: UtilityCommunication, switches: "\372"]/dhu>	<AMesa>13.0>Doc>SampleUser.cm is a sample User.cm containing all of the sections and entries recognized by the released tools. (Although some tools in this example do not have entries for WindowBox, TinyPlace, and InitialState, all released tools recognize these entries).  LIBRARIAN>	Librarian service:  The Set Backup Path command also prompts for the number of backup versions to keep.  It will keep this number of copies of the data base index and record files for recovery purposes.  Only one version is necessary; additional copies are simply precautionary.  ExampleLS!Set Backup Path         Which database?        1    Mesa-Libjects        2    Pilot-Libjects        Enter choice number: 2        Path to back up files for this data base:  (Rasp:osbu north)LibrarianBackup/        Number of backup versions to keep (1..100):  2>	Librarian service:  The Checkin Libject command allows administrators to check in libjects checked out by someone other than themselves.  It prompts for the data base name and libject to be checked in.ExampleLS!Checkin Libject         Which database?        1    Mesa-Libjects        2    Pilot-Libjects        Enter choice number: 2        Libject name:  FileTransfer.dfChecking in FileTransfer.df ... Done.>	Librarian service:  strong authentication is now supported.INTERNAL TOOLS>	PupChat:  filename/F (read commands from a file) doesn't work.  PupChat will stuff initial commands into its window when a connection is opened if the autologin feature is enabled.  The commands stuffed can be specified in the User.cm as follows:    [PupChat]  machine: quotedStringWithCarriageReturns  booter: "execpupchat /u vaxc"  oxnard: "sets <main>me <main>">	TTYTajo:  The Protect.~ command isn't in TTYTajo.>	PupAdobe registers PupAdobe* (eg. PupAdobeEdit, PupAdobeQuery, ...) with the tooldriver.  Menu names are the same as Adobe's.  To use the tooldriver be sure you retrieve the latest PupAdobe.bcd and tool.sws and edit the tool names in the tooldriver script to refer to PupAdobe* instead of Adobe*.>	Extra backing store Pilot boot switches:Boot files built on Pilot 12.3b and later now have the ability to provide a larger backing store than was previously available.  Backing store is allocated at boot time depending upon what switches are used.  The current combinations of switches dealing with backing store are:  {   |   }   \365  pages  -   -   -     -   default (between 250 and 1000 depending upon volume size)  -   -   -     dn  325  pages  dn  -   -     -   550  pages  -   dn  -     -   1200 pages  -   -   dn    -   1800 pages         dn = using that switch  dn  dn  -     -   2500 pages  dn  -   dn    -   3500 pages  -   dn  dn    -   5000 pages  dn  dn  dn    -   7000 pages  You will always get the largest backing store specified (ex. the switches \365, |, and } together would give you 5000 pages -- equivalent to just | and } )If you get a 965 MP code while booting with this new Pilot Kernel, the switch combination you are using is too big (you don't have sufficient space on your volume) so use a smaller switch (or delete some files).
