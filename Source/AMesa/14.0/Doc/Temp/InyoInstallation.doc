You may start from scratch, (i.e. the disk contains no data.) or upgrade from Mesa 12.3.  Note: If you use Installer scripts to set up your machine, you need not follow the procedures described here. This document is aimed towards those who install software on their machine manually.---------------------------------------------------------------------------The main sections are:(If you are reading this in Tajo, select a line and hit the FIND key to skip to the section)B: Installing Mesa 14.0 from scratchD: Installing Mesa 14.0 from Mesa 12.3.E: Installing PUPs on Mesa 14.0.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Mesa 14.0 has changes in the Mesa architecture. You will need to get new programming tools from the alpha release directory to do development for Pilot 14.0.  Note: Your Mesa alpha release host server name is:	[K9:OSBU North:Xerox]Your Mesa alpha release directory is named:  	<AlphaMesa>14.0>Your Pilot alpha release host server name is:	[Dino:OSBU North:Xerox]Your Pilot alpha release directory is named	<AlphaPilot>14.0>If you are using a "local" copy of the above directories, please ask your neighbor where they are.---------------------------------------------------------------------------B: Installing Mesa 14.0 from scratchNote: "Quoted" items correspond to Installer commands. B.1	Boot Installer from a floppy or the Ethernet. Etherboot 3 will give you an Installer that accesses NS servers. If you ether boot the Installer, get into the command mode using the 911 command and the iaccepttherisk password.B.2	"Create Physical Volume" with the desired volumes. Minimum sizes based on volume content are:	  Tajo		10000	  Scavenger, User	Depends on the type of ViewPoint configuration you use.   Consult the ViewPoint installation documents for details.	Since CocoPilot is rarely useful with Sword, many users discard their CocoPilot volumes and distribute the space on other volumes.     B.3 	"Online" RD0 B.4 	Set up Installer to access the servers for microcode by typing in the following	"Clearinghouse" to set your domain and organization.  	"Login"  to give your login name and password. 	"Open" a connection to your Pilot alpha release host server.  	"Directory" to set directory to your Pilot alpha release host directory.  B.5 	"Initial microcode fetch" from SAX000Initial.db / DiskInitialDove.db	  (note that the X in the name is the letter "X", not a variable)B.6 	Fetch microcode and Germ (usually User volume). 	  - "Pilot microcode fetch" 		Mesa.db / MesaDaybreak.db	  - "Germ fetch" 			DLion.germ / Dove.germ	  - "Diagnostic microcode fetch" 	MoonBoot.db / MoonRise.dbB.7 	Set up Installer to access the servers for bootfiles by typing in the following	"Open" a connection to your Mesa alpha release host server.  	"Directory" to set directory to your Mesa alpha release host directory.  B.8	Fetch development environment boot files as desired. 	Use the "Fetch boot file" commands to...		  - Fetch Tajo 		TajoDLion.boot / TajoDove.bootB.9 	"Set Boot file default switches" for each volume if desired. Note that the 'W switch is no longer used.B.10	If you have debugger pointers set from any type normal volumes (besides Installer) to Tajo, clear them.	"Set Debugger Pointers	  for debuggee Logical Volume: User	  for debugger Logical Volume:	  (Clear existing pointers)	  Are you sure? [y or n]: Yes"B.11 	"Set Physical Volume boot files" (usually Tajo). B.12	"Quit" from Installer.  (This is equivalent to pushing the boot button.)B.13 	Boot Tajo. The first time you boot Mesa 14.0 XDE boot files, they will take much longer. (~3 minutes).B.14	From your Tajo volume, use the FileTool to retrieve whatever tools you desire from from the alpha release directory. B.15	Retrieve and run Sword. Edit your User.cm if you want to have separate outload files for your type normal volumes.	Example: 		  [Debugger]	  User: <>User.outload	  Scavenger: <>Scavenger.outload	Each Outload file is 2% larger than the size of real memory (approximately 1500 disk pages for 768KB memory, 2000 disk pages for 1MB memory). If there is no User.cm entry for a volume, the default outload file is Debuggee.outload.B.16 	Boot User. SHIFT-STOP. Create a debugging session by typing "Interpreter User.outload/o" in the Executive, if the outload file is named "User.outload". See release directory/Doc/SampleUser.cm for an example User.cm. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------D: Installing Mesa 14.0 from Mesa 12.3.To convert to 14.0 you need to get the new boot files, microcode, and tools.D.0.	Follow B.1 to boot Installer.D.1	Follow B.3 through B.13, fetching boot files only for volumes to be converted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------E: Installing PUPs on Mesa 14.0.The rest of this document describes how to runs Pups on a Mesa 14.0 bootfile.  Since Mesa 14.0 does NOT include Pups in them, you cannot fetch and store files to IFS servers unless you run Pups as described below.Note: Your Pup archive release location is:	[Bedrock:OSBU North:Xerox]<APup>14.0>Pup Tools are on the PupTools>Public subdirectory of the Pup archive release location.Pup users may want to read the section on the File Tool (Section B)_____________________________________________A) Running Pups.B) Effects on the Filetool._____________________________________________A) Running Pups.1. You must boot Tajo with the \330 switch to run Pups.2. Fetch PupConfig.bcd from the Pup>Public subdirectory of the Pup archive release directory.3. Run PupConfig.bcdInstead of running PupConfig.bcd each time you boot, you could change the InitialCommand line of your User.cm's [System] section to do it for you. [Tajo:System]InitialCommand: Run.~ PupConfig.bcdIf you include PupChat or other PUP programs in your IntitialCommand, put them after PupConfig.bcd._____________________________________________B) Effects on the Filetool.When you boot Tajo, run PupExec or PupConfig, and bring up the Filetool, you will notice that the {NS, Pup} choice is not displayed. That happened because Tajo ran your filetool BEFORE you even got a chance to run PupExec, so it thought it didn't need to give you a choise to run Pups. To solve this, first DE-ACTIVATE your file tool, and then (guess what) RE-ACTIVATE it, and then carefully look at the file tool. You will now realize that your beloved {NS, Pup} choice is displayed again!Rather than deactivating your Filetool each time, which gets to be a pain, here is a short cut.  Specify Pup servers by appending the character "%" to the host name in the file tool. This is like the ":" character you used to specify NS servers when Pup was the default. NS servers can be specified WITHOUT the trailing ":". Example:Old style -> 	Host: Goofy:	Directory: <Alphamesa>14.0>		Host: vaxc	Directory: <Int>		New style -> 	Host: Goofy	Directory: Alphamesa>14.0>		Host: vaxc%	Directory: <Int>		---------
