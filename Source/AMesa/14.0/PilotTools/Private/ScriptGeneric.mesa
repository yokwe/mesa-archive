A generic test-- procedure does some kind of general sequence of test operations and is called-- by a test script which varies the environment for or the arguments to the-- tests in some way.-- This interface contains only types and constants, and procedures which are-- implemented by modules with names like "ScriptGeneric<operation-name>".-- There is no ScriptGenericImpl.DIRECTORY  Environment USING [PageCount],  VM USING [Interval, ReturnWait];ScriptGeneric: DEFINITIONS =  BEGIN  ------------  -- PUBLIC types, constants, variables:  CopyProc: TYPE =    PROCEDURE [interval: VM.Interval, runLength: Environment.PageCount,    returnWait: VM.ReturnWait];  RestoreProc: TYPE = PROCEDURE;  ------------  -- PUBLIC procedures:  -- Optional, replaceable test for zeroing in on Copy bugs.  CopyBugTest: PROCEDURE [    copyProc1, copyProc2: CopyProc, restoreProc: RestoreProc,    regionSize: CARDINAL];  -- Test specified Copy operation in a standard set of tests in combination  -- with other operations.
