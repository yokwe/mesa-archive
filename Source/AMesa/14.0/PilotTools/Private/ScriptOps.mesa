A script registers itself with a central-- facility, providing a script procedure and a name string by which it may be-- identified.  A test program can access any registered script via the name-- string.  The script may also be deregistered when the test program is done-- with it.ScriptOps: DEFINITIONS =  BEGIN  ------------  -- PUBLIC types, constants, variables:  Script: TYPE = PROCEDURE;  maxNameLength: CARDINAL = 32;  ------------  -- PUBLIC procedures:  RegisterScript: PROCEDURE [script: Script, name: LONG STRING];    -- names longer than maxNameLength will be truncated.  DeregisterScript: PROCEDURE [name: LONG STRING];  GetNext: PROCEDURE [name: LONG STRING] RETURNS [LONG STRING];  GetScript: PROCEDURE [name: LONG STRING] RETURNS [Script];  Shutdown: PUBLIC PROCEDURE;  ------------  -- PUBLIC SIGNALs and ERRORs  NoSuchScript: ERROR;  END.LOG11-Nov-82 18:51:11   CAJ    Created file.
