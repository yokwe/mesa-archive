It also flushes the service cache (of addresses of remote file services).  This service cache is owned by the services boot file.    Run FixSystemElement.bcd on the Adobe service when the adobe tool reports the error, "File Service unavailable or down" and the file service is really running.  You must be log in and then run FixSystemElement when the adobe service is started.  FixSystemElement does not stop the service and clients will be able to communicate with the adobe service.  I don't know what will happen if a client tries to get the location of ars at the same time the FixSystemElement is resetting it.      After you have run FixSystemElement.bcd on the Adobe service, clients will have to reboot or deactivate and reactivate their Adobe tool.  This is because the Adobe tool caches the file service address.    I don't know the cause of this problem.  It seems to happen from time to time.  It appears that the service cache that the services boot file maintains somehow get 0's in the address for the file services.  By resetting the service cache, the problem gets corrected.    FixOneSystemElement.bcd is a version of FixSystemElement that takes an adobe database as a parameter. This is useful when FixSystemElement fails because the user doesn't have access to a file drawer. It can also be used to tweak the cache entry when a file server moves to a new net address. The parameter is the ordinal number of the database (where the enumeration starts with the numeral 0). An easy way to derive the number is to use show system parameters (which numbers the databases beginning with the numeral 1). Choose the database from this list and subtract 1 to get the proper number to pass to FixOneSystemElement. FixOneSystemElement posts a message giving the name of the database it is fixing the cache entry for. As above users will have to unload and reload their Adobe tools.
