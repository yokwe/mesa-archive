All rights reserved.The floppy tape support code consists of the interfaces  AccessFloppyTape  CartridgeTapeDirectoryand implementations   AccessFloppyTapeImpl   CartridgeTapeDirectoryImpl   FloppyTapeExec   CartridgeTapeDirExecCmdImplThere is a config for the tool to be run in the XDE executive. Network Services includes the individual pieces in ServiceBaseConfig. The tool which runs in the XDE Executive (TTYTajoDLight.boot) is FloppyTapeCommands.bcd. This tool registers 2 commands with the executive: FloppyTape.~, and CartridgeTapeDir.~. The first supports formating, reading, writing, and other operations with the tape. These operations are implemented in FloppyTapeExec.mesa. The code implementing the CartridgeTapeDir.~ command is in CartridgeTapeDirExecCmdImpl.mesa. This command provides the operations to list, write, and verify the directory file on the tape. The directory should be written only after all other files have been written on the tape using the FloppyTape.~ Write command. The components AccessFloppyTapeImpl, CartridgeTapeDirectoryImpl, and FloppyTapeImp.bcd (the Pilot code implementing FloppyTape interface) are bound into ServicesBaseConfig.
