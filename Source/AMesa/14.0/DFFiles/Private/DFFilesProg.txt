That's in DFVersionImpl. Rebuild the system using the RIM (Rim Isn't Make) tool using DFFiles.make as the makefile.Some items in DFfiles.df are not used in the current program. That's the OldDFTool*. Ignore them, but I keep them for checking out bugs in the old systemWhen you change the tool, use the FormSWLayOut tool to change the .by files and stuff the results into DFToolFormsImpl. Change the fake RBRACKET tokens to the real characters '[ with the editor.Make sure ERRORS are kept in abstraction boundaries.Catch all for errors are in DFToolCommands.Use the statistics program to get the size info. Look for the large global frame that it has.
