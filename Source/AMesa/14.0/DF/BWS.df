Before the Mesa-- release, they point to [Stanford:OSBU South:Xerox]<ABasicWS>. -- During the Mesa release, these pointers-- are changed to the appropriate archive directory. After the Mesa files are-- moved to the archive directory but before the release terminates, they are-- changed back to point to <>.-- Copyright (C) 1988 by Xerox Corporation.
